individuals and their original powers into a few
sharply marked-off classes; it has taught us that
original capacities are indefinitely numerous and
variable. It is but the other side of this fact to say
that in the degree in which society has become
democratic, social organization means utilization
of the specific and variable qualities of individuals,
not stratification by classes. Although his
educational philosophy was revolutionary, it was
none the less in bondage to static ideals. He
thought that change or alteration was evidence of
lawless flux; that true reality was unchangeable.
Hence while he would radically change the
existing state of society, his aim was to construct a
state in which change would subsequently have
no place. The final end of life is fixed; given a state
framed with this end in view, not even minor
details are to be altered. Though they might not be
inherently important, yet if permitted they would
inure the minds of men to the idea of change, and
hence be dissolving and anarchic. The breakdown
of his philosophy is made apparent in the fact that
he could not trust to gradual improvements in
education to bring about a better society which
should then improve education, and so on
indefinitely. Correct education could not come into
existence until an ideal state existed, and after
that education would be devoted simply to its
conservation. For the existence of this state he
was obliged to trust to some happy accident by
which philosophic wisdom should happen to
