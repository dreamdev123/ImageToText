activity. Thus one aims at, say, a rabbit; what he
wants is to shoot straight: a certain kind of
activity. Or, if it is the rabbit he wants, it is not
rabbit apart from his activity, but as a factor in
activity; he wants to eat the rabbit, or to show it
as evidence of his marksmanship—he wants to do
something with it. The doing with the thing, not
the thing in isolation, is his end. The object is but a
phase of the active end,—continuing the activity
successfully. This is what is meant by the phrase,
used above, "freeing activity."

In contrast with fulfilling some process in order
that activity may go on, stands the static
character of an end which is imposed from
without the activity. It is always conceived of as
fixed; itis something to be attained and possessed.
‘When one has such a notion, activity is a mere
unavoidable means to something else; it is not
significant or important on its own account. As
compared with the end it is but a necessary evil;
something which must be gone through before
one can reach the object which is alone worth
while. In other words, the external idea of the aim
leads to a separation of means from end, while an
end which grows up within an activity as plan for
its direction is always both ends and means, the
distinction being only one of convenience. Every
means is a temporary end until we have attained
it. Every end becomes a means of carrying activity
further as soon as it is achieved. We call it end
