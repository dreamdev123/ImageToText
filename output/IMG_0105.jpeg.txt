when it marks off the future direction of the
activity in which we are engaged; means when it
marks off the present direction. Every divorce of
end from means diminishes by that much the
significance of the activity and tends to reduce it
to a drudgery from which one would escape if he
could. A farmer has to use plants and animals to
carry on his farming activities. It certainly makes
a great difference to his life whether he is fond of
them, or whether he regards them merely as
means which he has to employ to get something
else in which alone he is interested. In the former
case, his entire course of activity is significant;
each phase of it has its own value. He has the
experience of realizing his end at every stage; the
postponed aim, or end in view, being merely a
sight ahead by which to keep his activity going
fully and freely. For if he does not look ahead, he
is more likely to find himself blocked. The aim is
as definitely a means of action as is any other
portion of an activity.

3. Applications in Education. There is nothing
peculiar about educational aims. They are just
like aims in any directed occupation. The educator,
like the farmer, has certain things to do, certain
resources with which to do, and certain obstacles
with which to contend. The conditions with which
the farmer deals, whether as obstacles or
resources, have their own structure and
operation independently of any purpose of his.
