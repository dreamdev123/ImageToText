not there; neither can the educator. In this sense,
heredity is a limit of education. Recognition of this
fact prevents the waste of energy and the
irritation that ensue from the too prevalent habit
of trying to make by instruction something out of
an individual which he is not naturally fitted to
become. But the doctrine does not determine what
use shall be made of the capacities which exist.
And, except in the case of the imbecile, these
original capacities are much more varied and
potential, even in the case of the more stupid,
than we as yet know properly how to utilize.
Consequently, while a careful study of the native
aptitudes and deficiencies of an individual is
always a preliminary necessity, the subsequent
and important step is to furnish an environment
which will adequately function whatever
activities are present. The relation of heredity and
environment is well expressed in the case of
language. If a being had no vocal organs from
which issue articulate sounds, if he had no
auditory or other sensereceptors and no
connections between the two sets of apparatus, it
â€˜would be a sheer waste of time to try to teach him
to converse. He is born short in that respect, and
education must accept the limitation. But if he has
this native equipment, its possession in no way
guarantees that he will ever talk any language or

which his activities occur and by which they are
carried into execution settles these things. If he
