The account of education given in our earlier
chapters virtually anticipated the results reached
in a discussion of the purport of education in a
democratic community. For it assumed that the
aim of education is to enable individuals to
continue their educationâ€”or that the object and
reward of learning is continued capacity for
growth. Now this idea cannot be applied to all the
members of a society except where intercourse of
man with man is mutual, and except where there
is adequate provision for the reconstruction of
social habits and institutions by means of wide
stimulation arising from equitably distributed
interests. And this means a democratic society. In
our search for aims in education, we are not
concerned, therefore, with finding an end outside
of the educative process to which education is
subordinate. Our whole conception forbids. We
are rather concerned with the contrast which
exists when aims belong within the process in
which they operate and when they are set up
from without. And the latter state of affairs must
obtain when social relationships are not equitably
balanced. For in that case, some portions of the
whole social group will find their aims
determined by an external dictation; their aims
will not arise from the free growth of their own
experience, and their nominal aims will be means
to more ulterior ends of others rather than truly
their own.
