ground that life and instinct are a kind of
miraculous thing anyway. Thus we fail to note
â€˜what the essential characteristic of the event is;
namely, the significance of the temporal place and
order of each element; the way each prior event
leads into its successor while the successor takes
up what is furnished and utilizes it for some other
stage, until we arrive at the end, which, as it were,
summarizes and finishes off the process. Since
aims relate always to results, the first thing to
look to when it is a question of aims, is whether
the work assigned possesses intrinsic continuity.
Or is it a mere serial aggregate of acts, first doing
one thing and then another? To talk about an
educational aim when approximately each act of
a pupil is dictated by the teacher, when the only
order in the sequence of his acts is that which
comes from the assignment of lessons and the
giving of directions by another, is to talk nonsense.
It is equally fatal to an aim to permit capricious or
discontinuous action in the name of spontaneous
self-expression. An aim implies an orderly and
ordered activity, one in which the order consists
in the progressive completing of a process. Given
an activity having a time span and cumulative
growth within the time succession, an aim means
foresight in advance of the end or possible
termination. If bees anticipated the consequences
of their activity, if they perceived their end in
imaginative foresight, they would have the
primary element in an aim. Hence it is nonsense
