experiences of life. If he is not trained in the right
use of the products of industry, there is grave
danger that he may deprave himself and injure
others in his possession of wealth. No scheme of
education can afford to neglect such basic
considerations. Yet in the name of higher and
more spiritual ideals, the arrangements for higher
education have often not only neglected them, but
looked at them with scorn as beneath the level of
educative concern. With the change from an
oligarchical to a democratic society, it is natural
that the significance of an education which should
have as a result ability to make one's way
economically in the world, and to manage
economic resources usefully instead of for mere
display and luxury, should receive emphasis.
There is, however, grave danger that in
insisting upon this end, existing economic
conditions and standards will be accepted as final.
A democratic criterion requires us to develop
capacity to the point of competency to choose and
make its own career. This principle is violated
when the attempt is made to fit individuals in
advance for definite industrial callings, selected
not on the basis of trained original capacities, but
on that of the wealth or social status of parents.
As a matter of fact, industry at the present time
undergoes rapid and abrupt changes through the
evolution of new inventions. New industries
spring up, and old ones are revolutionized.
