Now for that ot discipline. Where an activity takes
time, where many means and obstacles lie
between its initiation and completion,
deliberation and persistence are required. It is
obvious that a very large part of the everyday
meaning of will is precisely the deliberate or
conscious disposition to persist and endure in a
planned course of action in spite of difficulties and
contrary solicitations. A man of strong will, in the
popular usage of the words, is a man who is
neither fickle nor half-hearted in achieving
chosen ends. His ability is executive; that is, he
persistently and energetically strives to execute or
carry out his aims. A weak will is unstable as
water.

Clearly there are two factors in will. One has to
do with the foresight of results, the other with the
depth of hold the foreseen outcome has upon the
person.

(D) Obstinacy is persistence but it is not strength
of volition. Obstinacy may be mere animal inertia
and insensitiveness. A man keeps on doing a thing
just because he has got started, not because of
any clearly thought-out purpose. In fact, the
obstinate man generally declines (although he
may not be quite aware of his refusal) to make
clear to himself what his proposed end is; he has a
feeling that if he allowed himself to get a clear and
full idea of it, it might not be worth while.
