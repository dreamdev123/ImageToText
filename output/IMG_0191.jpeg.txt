be absurd if the farmer set up a purpose of
farming, without any reference to these
conditions of soil, climate, characteristic of plant
growth, etc. His purpose is simply a foresight of
the consequences of his energies connected with
those of the things about him, a foresight used to

of possible consequences leads to more careful
and extensive observation of the nature and
performances of the things he had to do with, and
to laying out a plan—that is, of a certain order in
the acts to be performed.

It is the same with the educator, whether
parent or teacher. It is as absurd for the latter to

responsibility for the observations, anticipations,
