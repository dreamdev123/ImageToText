connections and continuities of the activities in
which we are engaged. The activity begins in an
impulsive form; that is, it is blind. It does not
know what it is about; that is to say, what are its
interactions with other activities. An activity
which brings education or instruction with it
makes one aware of some of the connections
which had been imperceptible. To recur to our
simple example, a child who reaches for a bright
light gets burned. Henceforth he knows that a
certain act of touching in connection with a
certain act of vision (and vice-versa) means heat
and pain; or, a certain light means a source of
heat. The acts by which a scientific man in his
laboratory learns more about flame differ no whit
in principle. By doing certain things, he makes
perceptible certain connections of heat with other
things, which had been previously ignored. Thus
his acts in relation to these things get more
meaning; he knows better what he is doing or "is
about” when he has to do with them; he can
intend consequences instead of just letting them
happen—all synonymous ways of saying the
same thing. At the same stroke, the flame has
gained in meaning; all that is known about
combustion, oxidation, about light and
temperature, may become an intrinsic part of its
intellectual content.
