Our first question is to define the nature of an
aim so far as it falls within an activity, instead of
being furnished from without. We approach the
definition by a contrast of mere results with ends.
Any exhibition of energy has results. The wind
blows about the sands of the desert; the position
of the grains is changed. Here is a result, an effect,
but not an end. For there is nothing in the
outcome which completes or fulfills what went
before it. There is mere spatial redistribution. One
state of affairs is just as good as any other.
Consequently there is no basis upon which to
select an earlier state of affairs as a beginning, a
later as an end, and to consider what intervenes
as a process of transformation and realization.

Consider for example the activities of bees in
contrast with the changes in the sands when the
wind blows them about. The results of the beesâ€™
actions may be called ends not because they are
designed or consciously intended, but because
they are true terminations or completions of what
has preceded. When the bees gather pollen and
make wax and build cells, each step prepares the
way for the next. When cells are built, the queen
lays eggs in them; when eggs are laid, they are
sealed and bees brood them and keep them at a
temperature required to hatch them. When they
are hatched, bees feed the young till they can take
care of themselves. Now we are so familiar with
such facts, that we are apt to dismiss them on the
