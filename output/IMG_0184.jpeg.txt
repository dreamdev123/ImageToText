who participate in an interest so that each has to
refer his own action to that of others, and to
consider the action of others to give point and
direction to his own, is equivalent to the breaking
down of those barriers of class, race, and national
territory which kept men from perceiving the full
import of their activity. These more numerous
and more varied points of contact denote a
greater diversity of stimuli to which an individual
has to respond; they consequently put a premium
on variation in his action. They secure a liberation
of powers which remain suppressed as long as
the incitations to action are partial, as they must
be in a group which in its exclusiveness shuts out
many interests.

The widening of the area of shared concerns,
and the liberation of a greater diversity of
personal capacities which characterize a
democracy, are not of course the product of
deliberation and conscious effort. On the contrary,
they were caused by the development of modes of
manufacture and commerce, travel, migration,
and intercommunication which flowed from the
command of science over natural energy. But
after greater individualization on one hand, and a
