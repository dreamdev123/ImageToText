better what is said in the first sentences. The three
factors of educative development are (a) the
native structure of our bodily organs and their
functional activities; (b) the uses to which the
activities of these organs are put under the
influence of other persons; (c) their direct
interaction with the environment. This statement
certainly covers the ground. His other two
propositions are equally sound; namely, (a) that
only when the three factors of education are
consonant and cooperative does adequate
development of the individual occur, and (b) that
the native activities of the organs, being original,
are basic in conceiving consonance. But it
requires but little reading between the lines,
supplemented by other statements of Rousseau,
to perceive that instead of regarding these three
things as factors which must work together to
some extent in order that any one of them may
proceed educatively, he regards them as separate
and independent operations. Especially does he
believe that there is an independent and, as he
says, "spontaneous" development of the native
organs and faculties. He thinks that this
development can go on irrespective of the use to
