perfunctory and superficial where there is no
interest. Parents and teachers often complain—
and correctly—that children "do not want to hear,
or want to understand.” Their minds are not upon
the subject precisely because it does not touch
them; it does not enter into their concerns. This is
a state of things that needs to be remedied, but the
remedy is not in the use of methods which
increase indifference and aversion. Even
punishing a child for inattention is one way of
trying to make him realize that the matter is not a
thing of complete unconcern; it is one way of
arousing "interest," or bringing about a sense of
connection. In the long run, its value is measured
by whether it supplies a mere physical excitation
to act in the way desired by the adult or whether
itleads the child "to think" —that is, to reflect upon
his acts and impregnate them with aims.

(ii) That interest is requisite for executive
persistence is even more obvious. Employers do
not advertise for workmen who are not interested
in what they are doing. If one were engaging a
lawyer or a doctor, it would never occur to one to
reason that the person engaged would stick to his
work more conscientiously if it was so
uncongenial to him that he did it merely from a
sense of obligation. Interest measures—or rather
is—the depth of the grip which the foreseen end
has upon one, moving one to act for its realization.
