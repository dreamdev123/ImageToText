<html><p>effort, with mere strain, results when a mind is
set up, endowed with powers that are only to be
applied to existing material. A person just either
will or will not apply himself to the matter in
hand. The more indifferent the subject matter, the
less concern it has for the habits and preferences
of the individual, the more demand there is for an
effort to bring the mind to bear upon it—and
hence the more discipline of will. To attend to
material because there is something to be done in
which the person is concerned is not disciplinary
in this view; not even if it results in a desirable
increase of constructive power. Application just
for the sake of application, for the sake of training,
is alone disciplinary. This is more likely to occur if
the subject matter presented is uncongenial, for
then there is no motive (so it is supposed) except
the acknowledgment of duty or the value of
discipline. The logical result is expressed with
literal truth in the words of an American
humorist: "It makes no difference what you teach
a boy so long as he doesn't like it."
The counterpart of the isolation of mind from
activities dealing with objects to accomplish ends
is isolation of the subject matter to be learned. In
the traditional schemes of education, subject
matter means so much material to be studied.
Various branches of study represent so many
independent branches, each having its principles
of arrangement complete within itself. History is</p><hr/><p>involved, but hitherto unperceived. The later
outcome thus reveals the meaning of the earlier,
while the experience as a whole establishes a bent
or disposition toward the things possessing this
meaning. Every such continuous experience or
activity is educative, and all education resides in
having such experiences.
It remains only to point out (what will receive
more ample attention later) that the
reconstruction of experience may be social as well
as personal. For purposes of simplification we
have spoken in the earlier chapters somewhat as
if the education of the immature which fills them
with the spirit of the social group to which they
belong, were a sort of catching up of the child with
the aptitudes and resources of the adult group. In
static societies, societies which make the
maintenance of established custom their measure
of value, this conception applies in the main. But
not in progressive communities. They endeavor to
shape the experiences of the young so that
instead of reproducing current habits, better
habits shall be formed, and thus the future adult
society be an improvement on their own. Men
have long had some intimation of the extent to
which education may be consciously used to
eliminate obvious social evils through starting the
young on paths which shall not produce these ills,
and some idea of the extent in which education
may be made an instrument of realizing the</p><hr/><p>construction of specific procedures, and unless
these procedures test, correct, and amplify the
aim, the latter is worthless. Instead of helping the
specific task of teaching, it prevents the use of
ordinary judgment in observing and sizing up the
situation. It operates to exclude recognition of
everything except what squares up with the fixed
end in view. Every rigid aim just because it is
rigidly given seems to render it unnecessary to
give careful attention to concrete conditions. Since
it must apply anyhow, what is the use of noting
details which do not count?
The vice of externally imposed ends has deep
roots. Teachers receive them from superior
authorities; these authorities accept them from
what is current in the community. The teachers
impose them upon children. As a first
consequence, the intelligence of the teacher is not
free; it is confined to receiving the aims laid down
from above. Too rarely is the individual teacher so
free from the dictation of authoritative supervisor,
textbook on methods, prescribed course of study,
etc, that he can let his mind come to close
quarters with the pupil's mind and the subject
matter. This distrust of the teacher's experience is
then reflected in lack of confidence in the
responses of pupils. The latter receive their aims
through a double or treble external imposition,
and are constantly confused by the conflict
between the aims which are natural to their own</p><hr/><p>culture of others. Externally, the question is
concerned with the reconciliation of national
loyalty, of patriotism, with superior devotion to
the things which unite men in common ends,
irrespective of national political boundaries.
Neither phase of the problem can be worked out
by merely negative means. It is not enough to see
to it that education is not actively used as an
instrument to make easier the exploitation of one
class by another. School facilities must be secured
of such amplitude and efficiency as will in fact
and not simply in name discount the effects of
economic inequalities, and secure to all the wards
of the nation equality of equipment for their
future careers. Accomplishment of this end
demands not only adequate administrative
provision of school facilities, and such
supplementation of family resources as will
enable youth to take advantage of them, but also
such modification of traditional ideals of culture,
traditional subjects of study and traditional
methods of teaching and discipline as will retain
all the youth under educational influences until
they are equipped to be masters of their own
economic and social careers. The ideal may seem
remote of execution, but the democratic ideal of
education is a farcical yet tragic delusion except
as the ideal more and more dominates our public
system of education. The same principle has
application on the side of the considerations
which concern the relations of one nation to</p><hr/><p>experiences of life. If he is not trained in the right
use of the products of industry, there is grave
danger that he may deprave himself and injure
others in his possession of wealth. No scheme of
education can afford to neglect such basic
considerations. Yet in the name of higher and
more spiritual ideals, the arrangements for higher
education have often not only neglected them, but
looked at them with scorn as beneath the level of
educative concern. With the change from an
oligarchical to a democratic society, it is natural
that the significance of an education which should
have as a result ability to make one's way
economically in the world, and to manage
economic resources usefully instead of for mere
display and luxury, should receive emphasis.
There is, however, grave danger that in
insisting upon this end, existing economic
conditions and standards will be accepted as final.
A democratic criterion requires us to develop
capacity to the point of competency to choose and
make its own career. This principle is violated
when the attempt is made to fit individuals in
advance for definite industrial callings, selected
not on the basis of trained original capacities, but
on that of the wealth or social status of parents.
As a matter of fact, industry at the present time
undergoes rapid and abrupt changes through the
evolution of new inventions. New industries
spring up, and old ones are revolutionized.</p><hr/><p>and feeling of civilized men. To ignore the
directive influence of this present environment
upon the young is simply to abdicate the
educational function. A biologist has said: "The
history of development in different animals. . .
offers to us. . . a series of ingenious, determined,
varied but more or less unsuccessful efforts to
escape from the necessity of recapitulating, and to
substitute for the ancestral method a more direct
method." Surely it would be foolish if education
did not deliberately attempt to facilitate similar
efforts in conscious experience so that they
become increasingly successful.
The two factors of truth in the conception may
easily be disentangled from association with the
false context which perverts them. On the
biological side we have simply the fact that any
infant starts with precisely the assortment of
impulsive activities with which he does start, they
being blind, and many of them conflicting with
one another, casual, sporadic, and unadapted to
their immediate environment. The other point is
thatit is a part of wisdom to utilize the products of
past history so far as they are of help for the
future. Since they represent the results of prior
experience, their value for future experience may,
of course, be indefinitely great. Literatures
produced in the past are, so far as men are now in
possession and use of them, a part of the present
environment of individuals; but there is an</p><hr/><p>connections and continuities of the activities in
which we are engaged. The activity begins in an
impulsive form; that is, it is blind. It does not
know what it is about; that is to say, what are its
interactions with other activities. An activity
which brings education or instruction with it
makes one aware of some of the connections
which had been imperceptible. To recur to our
simple example, a child who reaches for a bright
light gets burned. Henceforth he knows that a
certain act of touching in connection with a
certain act of vision (and vice-versa) means heat
and pain; or, a certain light means a source of
heat. The acts by which a scientific man in his
laboratory learns more about flame differ no whit
in principle. By doing certain things, he makes
perceptible certain connections of heat with other
things, which had been previously ignored. Thus
his acts in relation to these things get more
meaning; he knows better what he is doing or "is
about” when he has to do with them; he can
intend consequences instead of just letting them
happen—all synonymous ways of saying the
same thing. At the same stroke, the flame has
gained in meaning; all that is known about
combustion, oxidation, about light and
temperature, may become an intrinsic part of its
intellectual content.
(2) The other side of an educative experience is
an added power of subsequent direction or</p><hr/><p>greater reliance upon the recognition of mutual
interests as a factor in social control. The second
means not only freer interaction between social
groups (once isolated so far as intention could
keep up a separation) but change in social habit—
its continuous readjustment through meeting the
new situations produced by varied intercourse.
And these two traits are precisely what
characterize the democratically constituted
society.
Upon the educational side, we note first that the
realization of a form of social life in which
interests are mutually interpenetrating, and
‘where progress, or readjustment, is an important
consideration, makes a democratic community
more interested than other communities have
cause to be in deliberate and systematic education.
The devotion of democracy to education is a
familiar fact. The superficial explanation is that a
government resting upon popular suffrage cannot
be successful unless those who elect and who
obey their governors are educated. Since a
democratic society repudiates the principle of
external authority, it must find a substitute in
voluntary disposition and interest; these can be
created only by education. But there is a deeper
explanation. A democracy is more than a form of
government; it is primarily a mode of associated
living, of conjoint communicated experience. The
extension in space of the number of individuals</p><hr/><p>there is a disposition to take considerations which
are dear to the hearts of adults and set them up as
ends irrespective of the capacities of those
educated. There is also an inclination to propound
aims which are so uniform as to neglect the
specific powers and requirements of an individual,
forgetting that all learning is something which
happens to an individual at a given time and place.
The larger range of perception of the adult is of
great value in observing the abilities and
‘weaknesses of the young, in deciding what they
may amount to. Thus the artistic capacities of the
adult exhibit what certain tendencies of the child
are capable of; if we did not have the adult
achievements we should be without assurance as
to the significance of the drawing, reproducing,
modeling, coloring activities of childhood. So if it
were not for adult language, we should not be
able to see the import of the babbling impulses of
infancy. But it is one thing to use adult
accomplishments as a context in which to place
and survey the doings of childhood and youth; it
is quite another to set them up as a fixed aim
without regard to the concrete activities of those
educated.
(2) An aim must be capable of translation into a
method of cooperating with the activities of those
undergoing instruction. It must suggest the kind
of environment needed to liberate and to organize
their capacities. Unless it lends itself to the</p><hr/><p>when it marks off the future direction of the
activity in which we are engaged; means when it
marks off the present direction. Every divorce of
end from means diminishes by that much the
significance of the activity and tends to reduce it
to a drudgery from which one would escape if he
could. A farmer has to use plants and animals to
carry on his farming activities. It certainly makes
a great difference to his life whether he is fond of
them, or whether he regards them merely as
means which he has to employ to get something
else in which alone he is interested. In the former
case, his entire course of activity is significant;
each phase of it has its own value. He has the
experience of realizing his end at every stage; the
postponed aim, or end in view, being merely a
sight ahead by which to keep his activity going
fully and freely. For if he does not look ahead, he
is more likely to find himself blocked. The aim is
as definitely a means of action as is any other
portion of an activity.
3. Applications in Education. There is nothing
peculiar about educational aims. They are just
like aims in any directed occupation. The educator,
like the farmer, has certain things to do, certain
resources with which to do, and certain obstacles
with which to contend. The conditions with which
the farmer deals, whether as obstacles or
resources, have their own structure and
operation independently of any purpose of his.</p><hr/><p>situation of human intercourse. On the one hand,
science, commerce, and art transcend national
boundaries. They are largely international in
quality and method. They involve
interdependencies and cooperation among the
peoples inhabiting different countries. At the
same time, the idea of national sovereignty has
never been as accentuated in politics as it is at the
present time. Each nation lives in a state of
suppressed hostility and incipient war with its
neighbors. Each is supposed to be the supreme
judge of its own interests, and it is assumed as
matter of course that each has interests which are
exclusively its own. To question this is to question
the very idea of national sovereignty which is
assumed to be basic to political practice and
political science. This contradiction (for it is
nothing less) between the wider sphere of
associated and mutually helpful social life and the
narrower sphere of exclusive and hence
potentially hostile pursuits and purposes, exacts
of educational theory a clearer conception of the
meaning of "social’ as a function and test of
education than has yet been attained. Is it possible
for an educational system to be conducted by a
national state and yet the full social ends of the
educative process not be restricted, constrained,
and corrupted? Internally, the question has to
face the tendencies, due to present economic
conditions, which split society into classes some of
which are made merely tools for the higher</p><hr/><p>individuals and their original powers into a few
sharply marked-off classes; it has taught us that
original capacities are indefinitely numerous and
variable. It is but the other side of this fact to say
that in the degree in which society has become
democratic, social organization means utilization
of the specific and variable qualities of individuals,
not stratification by classes. Although his
educational philosophy was revolutionary, it was
none the less in bondage to static ideals. He
thought that change or alteration was evidence of
lawless flux; that true reality was unchangeable.
Hence while he would radically change the
existing state of society, his aim was to construct a
state in which change would subsequently have
no place. The final end of life is fixed; given a state
framed with this end in view, not even minor
details are to be altered. Though they might not be
inherently important, yet if permitted they would
inure the minds of men to the idea of change, and
hence be dissolving and anarchic. The breakdown
of his philosophy is made apparent in the fact that
he could not trust to gradual improvements in
education to bring about a better society which
should then improve education, and so on
indefinitely. Correct education could not come into
existence until an ideal state existed, and after
that education would be devoted simply to its
conservation. For the existence of this state he
was obliged to trust to some happy accident by
which philosophic wisdom should happen to</p><hr/><p>because they do not meet the ideal requirements
of the notion of society, the answer, in part, is that
the conception of society is then made so "ideal"
as to be of no use, having no reference to facts;
and in part, that each of these organizations, no
matter how opposed to the interests of other
groups, has something of the praiseworthy
qualities of "Society" which hold it together. There
is honor among thieves, and a band of robbers
has a common interest as respects its members.
Gangs are marked by fraternal feeling, and
narrow cliques by intense loyalty to their own
codes. Family life may be marked by
exclusiveness, suspicion, and jealousy as to those
without, and yet be a model of amity and mutual
aid within. Any education given by a group tends
to socialize its members, but the quality and value
of the socialization depends upon the habits and
aims of the group. Hence, once more, the need of a
measure for the worth of any given mode of
social life. In seeking this measure, we have to
avoid two extremes. We cannot set up, out of our
heads, something we regard as an ideal society.
‘We must base our conception upon societies
which actually exist, in order to have any
assurance that our ideal is a practicable one. But,
as we have just seen, the ideal cannot simply
repeat the traits which are actually found. The
problem is to extract the desirable traits of forms
of community life which actually exist, and
employ them to criticize undesirable features and</p><hr/><p>nature was, after all, but to negate the very idea
of education; it was to trust to the accidents of
circumstance. Not only was some method
required but also some positive organ, some
administrative agency for carrying on the process
of instruction. The "complete and harmonious
development of all powers," having as its social
counterpart an enlightened and progressive
humanity, required definite organization for its
realization. Private individuals here and there
could proclaim the gospel; they could not execute
the work. A Pestalozzi could try experiments and
exhort philanthropically inclined persons having
‘wealth and power to follow his example. But even
Pestalozzi saw that any effective pursuit of the
new educational ideal required the support of the
state. The realization of the new education
destined to produce a new society was, after all,
dependent upon the activities of existing states.
The movement for the democratic idea inevitably
became a movement for publicly conducted and
administered schools.
So far as Europe was concerned, the historic
situation identified the movement for a state-
supported education with the nationalistic
movement in political life—a fact of incalculable
significance for subsequent movements. Under
the influence of German thought in particular,
education became a civic function and the civic
function was identified with the realization of the</p><hr/><p>personality with social discipline and political
subordination. It made the national state an
intermediary between the realization of private
personality on one side and of humanity on the
other. Consequently, it is equally possible to state
its animating principle with equal truth either in
the classic terms of "harmonious development of
all the powers of personality” or in the more
recent terminology of "social efficiency." All this
reinforces the statement which opens this chapter:
The conception of education as a social process
and function has no definite meaning until we
define the kind of society we have in mind. These
considerations pave the way for our second
conclusion. One of the fundamental problems of
education in and for a democratic society is set by
the conflict of a nationalistic and a wider social
aim. The earlier cosmopolitan and
“humanitarian” conception suffered both from
vagueness and from lack of definite organs of
execution and agencies of administration. In
Europe, in the Continental states particularly, the
new idea of the importance of education for
human welfare and progress was captured by
national interests and harnessed to do a work
whose social aim was definitely narrow and
exclusive. The social aim of education and its
national aim were identified, and the result was a
marked obscuring of the meaning of a social aim.
This confusion corresponds to the existing</p><hr/><p>connected with one another. We can definitely
foresee results only as we make careful scrutiny
of present conditions, and the importance of the
outcome supplies the motive for observations.
The more adequate our observations, the more
varied is the scene of conditions and obstructions
that presents itself, and the more numerous are
the alternatives between which choice may be
made. In turn, the more numerous the recognized
possibilities of the situation, or alternatives of
action, the more meaning does the chosen activity
possess, and the more flexibly controllable is it.
‘Where only a single outcome has been thought of,
the mind has nothing else to think of; the meaning
attaching to the act is limited. One only steams
ahead toward the mark. Sometimes such a
narrow course may be effective. But if unexpected
difficulties offer themselves, one has not as many
resources at command as if he had chosen the
same line of action after a broader survey of the
possibilities of the field. He cannot make needed
readjustments readily.
The net conclusion is that acting with an aim is
all one with acting intelligently. To foresee a
terminus of an act is to have a basis upon which
to observe, to select, and to order objects and our
own capacities. To do these things means to have
a mind—for mind is precisely intentional
purposeful activity controlled by perception of
facts and their relationships to one another. To</p><hr/><p>that opportunity for development of distinctive
capacities be afforded all. The separation of the
two aims in education is fatal to democracy; the
adoption of the narrower meaning of efficiency
deprives it of its essential justification.
The aim of efficiency (like any educational aim)
must be included within the process of experience.
When it is measured by tangible external
products, and not by the achieving of a
distinctively valuable experience, it becomes
materialistic. Results in the way of commodities
which may be the outgrowth of an efficient
personality are, in the strictest sense, by-products
of education: by-products which are inevitable
and important, but nevertheless by-products. To
set up an external aim strengthens by reaction
the false conception of culture which identifies it
with something purely "inner." And the idea of
perfecting an "inner" personality is a sure sign of
social divisions. What is called inner is simply that
which does not connect with others—which is not
capable of free and full communication. What is
termed spiritual culture has usually been futile,
with something rotten about it, just because it has
been conceived as a thing which a man might
have internally—and therefore exclusively. What
one is as a person is what one is as associated
with others, in a free give and take of intercourse.
This transcends both the efficiency which consists
in supplying products to others and the culture</p><hr/><p>against the prevalent notion of the total depravity
of innate human nature, and has had a powerful
influence in modifying the attitude towards
children’s interests. But it is hardly necessary to
say that primitive impulses are of themselves
neither good nor evil, but become one or the other
according to the objects for which they are
employed. That neglect, suppression, and
premature forcing of some instincts at the
expense of others, are responsible for many
avoidable ills, there can be no doubt. But the
moral is not to leave them alone to follow their
own "spontaneous development,” but to provide
an environment which shall organize them.
Returning to the elements of truth contained in
Rousseau's statements, we find that natural
development, as an aim, enables him to point the
means of correcting many evils in current
practices, and to indicate a number of desirable
specific aims. (1) Natural development as an aim
fixes attention upon the bodily organs and the
need of health and vigor. The aim of natural
development says to parents and teachers: Make
health an aim; normal development cannot be
had without regard to the vigor of the body—an
obvious enough fact and yet one whose due
recognition in practice would almost
automatically revolutionize many of our
educational practices. "Nature" is indeed a vague
and metaphorical term, but one thing that</p><hr/><p>Much which has been said so far is borrowed
from what Plato first consciously taught the
world. But conditions which he could not
intellectually control led him to restrict these
ideas in their application. He never got any
conception of the indefinite plurality of activities
which may characterize an individual and a
social group, and consequently limited his view to
a limited number of classes of capacities and of
social arrangements. Plato's starting point is that
the organization of society depends ultimately
upon knowledge of the end of existence. If we do
not know its end, we shall be at the mercy of
accident and caprice. Unless we know the end, the
good, we shall have no criterion for rationally
deciding what the possibilities are which should
be promoted, nor how social arrangements are to
be ordered. We shall have no conception of the
proper limits and distribution of activities—what
he called justice—as a trait of both individual and
social organization. But how is the knowledge of
the final and permanent good to be achieved? In
dealing with this question we come upon the
seemingly insuperable obstacle that such
knowledge is not possible save in a just and
harmonious social order. Everywhere else the
mind is distracted and misled by false valuations
and false perspectives. A disorganized and
factional society sets up a number of different
models and standards. Under such conditions it is
impossible for the individual to attain consistency</p><hr/><p>perfunctory and superficial where there is no
interest. Parents and teachers often complain—
and correctly—that children "do not want to hear,
or want to understand.” Their minds are not upon
the subject precisely because it does not touch
them; it does not enter into their concerns. This is
a state of things that needs to be remedied, but the
remedy is not in the use of methods which
increase indifference and aversion. Even
punishing a child for inattention is one way of
trying to make him realize that the matter is not a
thing of complete unconcern; it is one way of
arousing "interest," or bringing about a sense of
connection. In the long run, its value is measured
by whether it supplies a mere physical excitation
to act in the way desired by the adult or whether
itleads the child "to think" —that is, to reflect upon
his acts and impregnate them with aims.
(ii) That interest is requisite for executive
persistence is even more obvious. Employers do
not advertise for workmen who are not interested
in what they are doing. If one were engaging a
lawyer or a doctor, it would never occur to one to
reason that the person engaged would stick to his
work more conscientiously if it was so
uncongenial to him that he did it merely from a
sense of obligation. Interest measures—or rather
is—the depth of the grip which the foreseen end
has upon one, moving one to act for its realization.
2. The Importance of the Idea of Interest in</p><hr/><p>to talk about the aim of education—or any other
undertaking—where conditions do not permit of
foresight of results, and do not stimulate a person
to look ahead to see what the outcome of a given
activity is to be. In the next place the aim as a
foreseen end gives direction to the activity; it is
not an idle view of a mere spectator, but
influences the steps taken to reach the end. The
foresight functions in three ways. In the first place,
it involves careful observation of the given
conditions to see what are the means available
for reaching the end, and to discover the
hindrances in the way. In the second place, it
suggests the proper order or sequence in the use
of means. It facilitates an economical selection
and arrangement. In the third place, it makes
choice of alternatives possible. If we can predict
the outcome of acting this way or that, we can
then compare the value of the two courses of
action; we can pass judgment upon their relative
desirability. If we know that stagnant water
breeds mosquitoes and that they are likely to
carry disease, we can, disliking that anticipated
result, take steps to avert it. Since we do not
anticipate results as mere intellectual onlookers,
but as persons concerned in the outcome, we are
partakers in the process which produces the
result. We intervene to bring about this result or
that.
Of course these three points are closely</p><hr/><p>instinctive activities may be called, metaphorically,
spontaneous, in the sense that the organs give a
strong bias for a certain sort of operation,—a bias
so strong that we cannot go contrary to it, though
by trying to go contrary we may pervert, stunt,
and corrupt them. But the notion of a
spontaneous normal development of these
activities is pure mythology. The natural, or native,
powers furnish the initiating and limiting forces
in all education; they do not furnish its ends or
aims. There is no learning except from a
beginning in unlearned powers, but learning is
not a matter of the spontaneous overflow of the
unlearned powers. Rousseau's contrary opinion is
doubtless due to the fact that he identified God
with Nature; to him the original powers are
wholly good, coming directly from a wise and
good creator. To paraphrase the old saying about
the country and the town, God made the original
human organs and faculties, man makes the uses
to which they are put. Consequently the
development of the former furnishes the standard
to which the latter must be subordinated. When
men attempt to determine the uses to which the
original activities shall be put, they interfere with
a divine plan. The interference by social
arrangements with Nature, God's work, is the
primary source of corruption in individuals.
Rousseau's passionate assertion of the intrinsic
goodness of all natural tendencies was a reaction</p><hr/><p>persons are naturally diverted from a proposed
course of action by unusual, unforeseen obstacles,
or by presentation of inducements to an action
that is directly more agreeable.
A person who is trained to consider his actions,
to undertake them deliberately, is in so far forth
disciplined. Add to this ability a power to endure
in an intelligently chosen course in face of
distraction, confusion, and difficulty, and you
have the essence of discipline. Discipline means
power at command; mastery of the resources
available for carrying through the action
undertaken. To know what one is to do and to
move to do it promptly and by use of the requisite
means is to be disciplined, whether we are
thinking of an army or a mind. Discipline is
positive. To cow the spirit, to subdue inclination,
to compel obedience, to mortify the flesh, to make
a subordinate perform an uncongenial task—
these things are or are not disciplinary according
as they do or do not tend to the development of
power to recognize what one is about and to
persistence in accomplishment.
It is hardly necessary to press the point that
interest and discipline are connected, not opposed.
(i) Even the more purely intellectual phase of
trained power—apprehension of what one is
doing as exhibited in consequences—is not
possible without interest. Deliberation will be</p><hr/><p>And it is well to remind ourselves that
education as such has no aims. Only persons,
parents, and teachers, etc, have aims, not an
abstract idea like education. And consequently
their purposes are indefinitely varied, differing
with different children, changing as children grow
and with the growth of experience on the part of
the one who teaches. Even the most valid aims
‘which can be put in words will, as words, do more
harm than good unless one recognizes that they
are not aims, but rather suggestions to educators
as to how to observe, how to look ahead, and how
to choose in liberating and directing the energies
of the concrete situations in which they find
themselves. As a recent writer has said: "To lead
this boy to read Scott's novels instead of old
Sleuth's stories; to teach this girl to sew; to root
out the habit of bullying from John's make-up; to
prepare this class to study medicine, —these are
samples of the millions of aims we have actually
before us in the concrete work of education."
Bearing these qualifications in mind, we shall
proceed to state some of the characteristics found
in all good educational aims. (1) An educational
aim must be founded upon the intrinsic activities
and needs (including original instincts and
acquired habits) of the given individual to be
educated. The tendency of such an aim as
preparation is, as we have seen, to omit existing
powers, and find the aim in some remote
accomplishment or responsibility. In general,</p><hr/><p>In some individuals, appetites naturally
dominate; they are assigned to the laboring and
trading class, which expresses and supplies
human wants. Others reveal, upon education,
that over and above appetites, they have a
generous, outgoing, assertively courageous
disposition. They become the citizen-subjects of
the state; its defenders in war; its internal
guardians in peace. But their limit is fixed by their
lack of reason, which is a capacity to grasp the
universal. Those who possess this are capable of
the highest kind of education, and become in time
the legislators of the state—for laws are the
universals which control the particulars of
experience. Thus it is not true that in intent, Plato
subordinated the individual to the social whole.
But it is true that lacking the perception of the
uniqueness of every individual, his
incommensurability with others, and
consequently not recognizing that a society might
change and yet be stable, his doctrine of limited
powers and classes came in net effect to the idea
of the subordination of individuality. We cannot
better Plato's conviction that an individual is
happy and society well organized when each
individual engages in those activities for which he
has a natural equipment, nor his conviction that it
is the primary office of education to discover this
equipment to its possessor and train him for its
effective use. But progress in knowledge has made
us aware of the superficiality of Plato's lumping of</p><hr/><p>interest, there is not sufficient stimulus for
attention to the human factors and relationships
in industry. Intelligence is narrowed to the factors
concerned with technical production and
marketing of goods. No doubt, a very acute and
intense intelligence in these narrow lines can be
developed, but the failure to take into account the
significant social factors means none the less an
absence of mind, and a corresponding distortion
of emotional life. II. This illustration (whose point
is to be extended to all associations lacking
reciprocity of interest) brings us to our second
point. The isolation and exclusiveness of a gang or
clique brings its antisocial spirit into relief. But
this same spirit is found wherever one group has
interests "of its own" which shut it out from full
interaction with other groups, so that its
prevailing purpose is the protection of what it has
got, instead of reorganization and progress
through wider relationships. It marks nations in
their isolation from one another; families which
seclude their domestic concerns as if they had no
connection with a larger life; schools when
separated from the interest of home and
community; the divisions of rich and poor;
learned and unlearned. The essential point is that
isolation makes for rigidity and formal
institutionalizing of life, for static and selfish
ideals within the group. That savage tribes regard
aliens and enemies as synonymous is not
accidental. It springs from the fact that they have</p><hr/><p>industrial, scientific, religious, associations. There
are political parties with differing aims, social sets,
cliques, gangs, corporations, partnerships, groups
bound closely together by ties of blood, and so on
in endless variety. In many modern states and in
some ancient, there is great diversity of
populations, of varying languages, religions,
moral codes, and traditions. From this standpoint,
many a minor political unit, one of our large cities,
for example, is a congeries of loosely associated
societies, rather than an inclusive and permeating
community of action and thought. (See ante, p. 20.)
The terms society, community, are thus
ambiguous. They have both a eulogistic or
normative sense, and a descriptive sense; a
meaning de jure and a meaning de facto. In social
philosophy, the former connotation is almost
always uppermost. Society is conceived as one by
its very nature. The qualities which accompany
this unity, praiseworthy community of purpose
and welfare, loyalty to public ends, mutuality of
sympathy, are emphasized. But when we look at
the facts which the term denotes instead of
confining our attention to its intrinsic connotation,
‘we find not unity, but a plurality of societies, good
and bad. Men banded together in a criminal
conspiracy, business aggregations that prey upon
the public while serving it, political machines held
together by the interest of plunder, are included. If
it is said that such organizations are not societies</p><hr/><p>to it laden with the spoils of the past. A mind that
is adequately sensitive to the needs and occasions
of the present actuality will have the liveliest of
motives for interest in the background of the
present, and will never have to hunt for a way
back because it will never have lost connection.
3. Education as Reconstruction. In its contrast
with the ideas both of unfolding of latent powers
from within, and of the formation from without,
whether by physical nature or by the cultural
products of the past, the ideal of growth results in
the conception that education is a constant
reorganizing or reconstructing of experience. It
has all the time an immediate end, and so far as
activity is educative, it reaches that end—the
direct transformation of the quality of experience.
Infancy, youth, adult life—all stand on the same
educative level in the sense that what is really
learned at any and every stage of experience
constitutes the value of that experience, and in
the sense that it is the chief business of life at
every point to make living thus contribute to an
enrichment of its own perceptible meaning.
We thus reach a technical definition of
education: It is that reconstruction or
reorganization of experience which adds to the
meaning of experience, and which increases
ability to direct the course of subsequent
experience. (1) The increment of meaning
corresponds to the increased perception of the</p><hr/><p>In conclusion, we note that the early history of
the idea of following nature combined two factors
which had no inherent connection with one
another. Before the time of Rousseau educational
reformers had been inclined to urge the
importance of education by ascribing practically
unlimited power to it. All the differences between
peoples and between classes and persons among
the same people were said to be due to differences
of training, of exercise, and practice. Originally,
mind, reason, understanding is, for all practical
purposes, the same in all. This essential identity of
mind means the essential equality of all and the
possibility of bringing them all to the same level.
As a protest against this view, the doctrine of
accord with nature meant a much less formal and
abstract view of mind and its powers. It
substituted specific instincts and impulses and
physiological capacities, differing from individual
to individual (just as they differ, as Rousseau
pointed out, even in dogs of the same litter), for
abstract faculties of discernment, memory, and
generalization. Upon this side, the doctrine of
educative accord with nature has been reinforced
by the development of modern biology, physiology,
and psychology. It means, in effect, that great as is
the significance of nurture, of modification, and
transformation through direct educational effort,
nature, or unlearned capacities, affords the
foundation and ultimate resources for such
nurture. On the other hand, the doctrine of</p><hr/><p>reluctance to criticize ends which present
themselves than it does in persistence and energy
in use of means to achieve the end. The really
executive man is a man who ponders his ends,
who makes his ideas of the results of his actions
as clear and full as possible. The people we called
weak-willed or self-indulgent always deceive
themselves as to the consequences of their acts.
They pick out some feature which is agreeable
and neglect all attendant circumstances. When
they begin to act, the disagreeable results they
ignored begin to show themselves. They are
discouraged, or complain of being thwarted in
their good purpose by a hard fate, and shift to
some other line of action. That the primary
difference between strong and feeble volition is
intellectual, consisting in the degree of persistent
firmness and fullness with which consequences
are thought out, cannot be over-emphasized.
(ii) There is, of course, such a thing as a
speculative tracing out of results. Ends are then
foreseen, but they do not lay deep hold of a
person. They are something to look at and for
curiosity to play with rather than something to
achieve. There is no such thing as over-
intellectuality, but there is such a thing as a one-
sided intellectuality. A person "takes it out" as we
say in considering the consequences of proposed
lines of action. A certain flabbiness of fiber
prevents the contemplated object from gripping
him and engaging him in action. And most</p><hr/><p>adequate interplay of experiences—the more
action tends to become routine on the part of the
class at a disadvantage, and capricious, aimless,
and explosive on the part of the class having the
materially fortunate position. Plato defined a
slave as one who accepts from another the
purposes which control his conduct. This
condition obtains even where there is no slavery
in the legal sense. It is found wherever men are
engaged in activity which is socially serviceable,
but whose service they do not understand and
have no personal interest in. Much is said about
scientific management of work. It is a narrow
view which restricts the science which secures
efficiency of operation to movements of the
muscles. The chief opportunity for science is the
discovery of the relations of a man to his work—
including his relations to others who take part—
‘which will enlist his intelligent interest in what he
is doing. Efficiency in production often demands
division of labor. But it is reduced to a mechanical
routine unless workers see the technical,
intellectual, and social relationships involved in
what they do, and engage in their work because
of the motivation furnished by such perceptions.
The tendency to reduce such things as efficiency
of activity and scientific management to purely
technical externals is evidence of the one-sided
stimulation of thought given to those in control of
industry—those who supply its aims. Because of
their lack of all-round and well-balanced social</p><hr/><p>only get rid of the artificial man-imposed coercive
restrictions.
Education in accord with nature was thought to
be the first step in insuring this more social society.
It was plainly seen that economic and political
limitations were ultimately dependent upon
limitations of thought and feeling. The first step in
freeing men from external chains was to
emancipate them from the internal chains of false
beliefs and ideals. What was called social life,
existing institutions, were too false and corrupt to
be intrusted with this work. How could it be
expected to undertake it when the undertaking
meant its own destruction? "Nature" must then be
the power to which the enterprise was to be left.
Even the extreme sensationalistic theory of
knowledge which was current derived itself from
this conception. To insist that mind is originally
passive and empty was one way of glorifying the
possibilities of education. If the mind was a wax
tablet to be written upon by objects, there were no
limits to the possibility of education by means of
the natural environment. And since the natural
world of objects is a scene of harmonious "truth,"
this education would infallibly produce minds
filled with the truth.
5. Education as National and as Social. As soon
as the first enthusiasm for freedom waned, the
‘weakness of the theory upon the constructive side
became obvious. Merely to leave everything to</p><hr/><p>activity. Thus one aims at, say, a rabbit; what he
wants is to shoot straight: a certain kind of
activity. Or, if it is the rabbit he wants, it is not
rabbit apart from his activity, but as a factor in
activity; he wants to eat the rabbit, or to show it
as evidence of his marksmanship—he wants to do
something with it. The doing with the thing, not
the thing in isolation, is his end. The object is but a
phase of the active end,—continuing the activity
successfully. This is what is meant by the phrase,
used above, "freeing activity."
In contrast with fulfilling some process in order
that activity may go on, stands the static
character of an end which is imposed from
without the activity. It is always conceived of as
fixed; itis something to be attained and possessed.
‘When one has such a notion, activity is a mere
unavoidable means to something else; it is not
significant or important on its own account. As
compared with the end it is but a necessary evil;
something which must be gone through before
one can reach the object which is alone worth
while. In other words, the external idea of the aim
leads to a separation of means from end, while an
end which grows up within an activity as plan for
its direction is always both ends and means, the
distinction being only one of convenience. Every
means is a temporary end until we have attained
it. Every end becomes a means of carrying activity
further as soon as it is achieved. We call it end</p><hr/><p>dependence of those arrangements upon the
means used to educate the young. It would be
impossible to find a deeper sense of the function
of education in discovering and developing
personal capacities, and training them so that
they would connect with the activities of others.
Yet the society in which the theory was
propounded was so undemocratic that Plato could
not work out a solution for the problem whose
terms he clearly saw.
‘While he affirmed with emphasis that the place
of the individual in society should not be
determined by birth or wealth or any
conventional status, but by his own nature as
discovered in the process of education, he had no
perception of the uniqueness of individuals. For
him they fall by nature into classes, and into a
very small number of classes at that
Consequently the testing and sifting function of
education only shows to which one of three
classes an individual belongs. There being no
recognition that each individual constitutes his
own class, there could be no recognition of the
infinite diversity of active tendencies and
combinations of tendencies of which an
individual is capable. There were only three types
of faculties or powers in the individual's
constitution. Hence education would soon reach a
static limit in each class, for only diversity makes
change and progress.</p><hr/><p>instead of with the spirit and meaning of activity,
culture is opposed to efficiency. Whether called
culture or complete development of personality,
the outcome is identical with the true meaning of
social efficiency whenever attention is given to
what is unique in an individual—and he would
not be an individual if there were not something
incommensurable about him. Its opposite is the
mediocre, the average. Whenever distinctive
quality is developed, distinction of personality
results, and with it greater promise for a social
service which goes beyond the supply in quantity
of material commodities. For how can there be a
society really worth serving unless it is
constituted of individuals of significant personal
qualities?
The fact is that the opposition of high worth of
personality to social efficiency is a product of a
feudally organized society with its rigid division of
inferior and superior. The latter are supposed to
have time and opportunity to develop themselves
as human beings; the former are confined to
providing external products. When social
efficiency as measured by product or output is
urged as an ideal in a would-be democratic society,
it means that the depreciatory estimate of the
masses characteristic of an aristocratic
community is accepted and carried over. But if
democracy has a moral and ideal meaning, it is
that a social return be demanded from all and</p><hr/><p>He brought it into the sphere of conscious method;
it became a conscious business with a definite aim
and procedure, instead of being a compound of
casual inspiration and subservience to tradition.
Moreover, everything in teaching and discipline
could be specified, instead of our having to be
content with vague and more or less mystic
generalities about ultimate ideals and speculative
spiritual symbols. He abolished the notion of
ready-made faculties, which might be trained by
exercise upon any sort of material, and made
attention to concrete subject matter, to the
content, all-important. Herbart undoubtedly has
had a greater influence in bringing to the front
questions connected with the material of study
than any other educational philosopher. He stated
problems of method from the standpoint of their
connection with subject matter: method having to
do with the manner and sequence of presenting
new subject matter to insure its proper
interaction with old.
The fundamental theoretical defect of this view
lies in ignoring the existence in a living being of
active and specific functions which are developed
in the redirection and combination which occur
as they are occupied with their environment. The
theory represents the Schoolmaster come to his
own. This fact expresses at once its strength and
its weakness. The conception that the mind
consists of what has been taught, and that the</p><hr/><p>journalism, or philanthropy, or archaeology, or
collecting Japanese prints, or banking.
(i) By an interest we also mean the point at
which an object touches or engages a man; the
point where it influences him. In some legal
transactions a man has to prove "interest" in
order to have a standing at court. He has to show
that some proposed step concerns his affairs. A
silent partner has an interest in a business,
although he takes no active part in its conduct
because its prosperity or decline affects his profits
and liabilities.
(iii) When we speak of a man as interested in
this or that the emphasis falls directly upon his
personal attitude. To be interested is to be
absorbed in, wrapped up in, carried away by,
some object. To take an interest is to be on the
alert, to care about, to be attentive. We say of an
interested person both that he has lost himself in
some affair and that he has found himself in it.
Both terms express the engrossment of the self in
an object.
When the place of interest in education is
spoken of in a depreciatory way, it will be found
that the second of the meanings mentioned is first
exaggerated and then isolated. Interest is taken to
mean merely the effect of an object upon personal
advantage or disadvantage, success or failure.
Separated from any objective development of</p><hr/><p>not due to the products, but to the life of which
they were the products. A knowledge of the past
and its heritage is of great significance when it
enters into the present, but not otherwise. And the
mistake of making the records and remains of the
past the main material of education is that it cuts
the vital connection of present and past, and tends
to make the past a rival of the present and the
present a more or less futile imitation of the past.
Under such circumstances, culture becomes an
ornament and solace; a refuge and an asylum.
Men escape from the crudities of the present to
live in its imagined refinements, instead of using
what the past offers as an agency for ripening
these crudities. The present, in short, generates
the problems which lead us to search the past for
suggestion, and which supplies meaning to what
we find when we search. The past is the past
precisely because it does not include what is
characteristic in the present. The moving present
includes the past on condition that it uses the past
to direct its own movement. The past is a great
resource for the imagination; it adds a new
dimension to life, but OD condition that it be seen
as the past of the present, and not as another and
disconnected world. The principle which makes
little of the present act of living and operation of
growing, the only thing always present, naturally
looks to the past because the future goal which it
sets up is remote and empty. But having turned its
back upon the present, it has no way of returning</p><hr/><p>differences of endowment the dynamic values of
natural inequalities of growth, and utilize them,
preferring irregularity to the rounding out gained
by pruning will most closely follow that which
takes place in the body and thus prove most
effective.” 1 Observation of natural tendencies is
difficult under conditions of restraint. They show
themselves most readily in a child's spontaneous
sayings and doings,—that is, in those he engages
in when not put at set tasks and when not aware
of being under observation. It does not follow that
these tendencies are all desirable because they
are natural; but it does follow that since they are
there, they are operative and must be taken
account of. We must see to it that the desirable
ones have an environment which keeps them
active, and that their activity shall control the
direction the others take and thereby induce the
disuse of the latter because they lead to nothing.
Many tendencies that trouble parents when they
appear are likely to be transitory, and sometimes
too much direct attention to them only fixes a
child's attention upon them. At all events, adults
too easily assume their own habits and wishes as
standards, and regard all deviations of children's
impulses as evils to be eliminated. That
artificiality against which the conception of
following nature is so largely a protest, is the
outcome of attempts to force children directly into
the mold of grown-up standards.</p><hr/><p>Now for that ot discipline. Where an activity takes
time, where many means and obstacles lie
between its initiation and completion,
deliberation and persistence are required. It is
obvious that a very large part of the everyday
meaning of will is precisely the deliberate or
conscious disposition to persist and endure in a
planned course of action in spite of difficulties and
contrary solicitations. A man of strong will, in the
popular usage of the words, is a man who is
neither fickle nor half-hearted in achieving
chosen ends. His ability is executive; that is, he
persistently and energetically strives to execute or
carry out his aims. A weak will is unstable as
water.
Clearly there are two factors in will. One has to
do with the foresight of results, the other with the
depth of hold the foreseen outcome has upon the
person.
(D) Obstinacy is persistence but it is not strength
of volition. Obstinacy may be mere animal inertia
and insensitiveness. A man keeps on doing a thing
just because he has got started, not because of
any clearly thought-out purpose. In fact, the
obstinate man generally declines (although he
may not be quite aware of his refusal) to make
clear to himself what his proposed end is; he has a
feeling that if he allowed himself to get a clear and
full idea of it, it might not be worth while.
Stubbornness shows itself even more in</p><hr/><p>ground that life and instinct are a kind of
miraculous thing anyway. Thus we fail to note
‘what the essential characteristic of the event is;
namely, the significance of the temporal place and
order of each element; the way each prior event
leads into its successor while the successor takes
up what is furnished and utilizes it for some other
stage, until we arrive at the end, which, as it were,
summarizes and finishes off the process. Since
aims relate always to results, the first thing to
look to when it is a question of aims, is whether
the work assigned possesses intrinsic continuity.
Or is it a mere serial aggregate of acts, first doing
one thing and then another? To talk about an
educational aim when approximately each act of
a pupil is dictated by the teacher, when the only
order in the sequence of his acts is that which
comes from the assignment of lessons and the
giving of directions by another, is to talk nonsense.
It is equally fatal to an aim to permit capricious or
discontinuous action in the name of spontaneous
self-expression. An aim implies an orderly and
ordered activity, one in which the order consists
in the progressive completing of a process. Given
an activity having a time span and cumulative
growth within the time succession, an aim means
foresight in advance of the end or possible
termination. If bees anticipated the consequences
of their activity, if they perceived their end in
imaginative foresight, they would have the
primary element in an aim. Hence it is nonsense</p><hr/><p>lived in a dumb unsocial environment where men
refused to talk to one another and used only that
minimum of gestures without which they could
not get along, vocal language would be as
unachieved by him as if he had no vocal organs. If
the sounds which he makes occur in a medium of
persons speaking the Chinese language, the
activities which make like sounds will be selected
and coordinated. This illustration may be applied
to the entire range of the educability of any
individual. It places the heritage from the past in
its right connection with the demands and
opportunities of the present.
(2) The theory that the proper subject matter of
instruction is found in the culture-products of past
ages (either in general, or more specifically in the
particular literatures which were produced in the
culture epoch which is supposed to correspond
with the stage of development of those taught)
affords another instance of that divorce between
the process and product of growth which has
been criticized. To keep the process alive, to keep it
alive in ways which make it easier to keep it alive
in the future, is the function of educational subject
matter. But an individual can live only in the
present. The present is not just something which
comes after the past; much less something
produced by it. It is what life is in leaving the past
behind it. The study of past products will not help
us understand the present, because the present is</p><hr/><p>of the state is educational; that in particular the
regeneration of Germany is to be accomplished by
an education carried on in the interests of the
state, and that the private individual is of
necessity an egoistic, irrational being, enslaved to
his appetites and to circumstances unless he
submits voluntarily to the educative discipline of
state institutions and laws. In this spirit, Germany
was the first country to undertake a public,
universal, and compulsory system of education
extending from the primary school through the
university, and to submit to jealous state
regulation and supervision all private educational
enterprises. Two results should stand out from
this brief historical survey. The first is that such
terms as the individual and the social conceptions
of education are quite meaningless taken at large,
or apart from their context. Plato had the ideal of
an education which should equate individual
realization and social coherency and stability. His
situation forced his ideal into the notion of a
society organized in stratified classes, losing the
individual in the class. The eighteenth century
educational philosophy was highly individualistic
in form, but this form was inspired by a noble and
generous social ideal: that of a society organized
to include humanity, and providing for the
indefinite perfectibility of mankind. The idealistic
philosophy of Germany in the early nineteenth
century endeavored again to equate the ideals of
a free and complete development of cultured</p><hr/><p>of mind. Only a complete whole is fully self
consistent. A society which rests upon the
supremacy of some factor over another
irrespective of its rational or proportionate claims,
inevitably leads thought astray. It puts a premium
on certain things and slurs over others, and
creates a mind whose seeming unity is forced and
distorted. Education proceeds ultimately from the
patterns furnished by institutions, customs, and
laws. Only in a just state will these be such as to
give the right education; and only those who have
rightly trained minds will be able to recognize the
end, and ordering principle of things. We seem to
be caught in a hopeless circle. However, Plato
suggested a way out. A few men, philosophers or
lovers of wisdom—or truth—may by study learn
at least in outline the proper patterns of true
existence. If a powerful ruler should form a state
after these patterns, then its regulations could be
preserved. An education could be given which
would sift individuals, discovering what they
were good for, and supplying a method of
assigning each to the work in life for which his
nature fits him. Each doing his own part, and
never transgressing, the order and unity of the
whole would be maintained.
It would be impossible to find in any scheme of
philosophic thought a more adequate recognition
on one hand of the educational significance of
social arrangements and, on the other, of the</p><hr/><p>efficiency is confined to the service rendered by
overt acts, its chief constituent (because its only
guarantee) is omitted, —intelligent sympathy or
good will. For sympathy as a desirable quality is
something more than mere feeling; it is a
cultivated imagination for what men have in
common and a rebellion at whatever
unnecessarily divides them. What is sometimes
called a benevolent interest in others may be but
an unwitting mask for an attempt to dictate to
them what their good shall be, instead of an
endeavor to free them so that they may seek and
find the good of their own choice. Social efficiency,
even social service, are hard and metallic things
when severed from an active acknowledgment of
the diversity of goods which life may afford to
different persons, and from faith in the social
utility of encouraging every individual to make
his own choice intelligent.
3. Culture as Aim. Whether or not social
efficiency is an aim which is consistent with
culture turns upon these considerations. Culture
means at least something cultivated, something
ripened; it is opposed to the raw and crude. When
the "natural" is identified with this rawness,
culture is opposed to what is called natural
development. Culture is also something personal;
it is cultivation with respect to appreciation of
ideas and art and broad human interests. When
efficiency is identified with a narrow range of acts,</p><hr/><p>fact that we rarely make it explicit. We overlook
the fact that in growth there is ground to be
covered between an initial stage of process and
the completing period; that there is something
intervening. In learning, the present powers of the
pupil are the initial stage; the aim of the teacher
represents the remote limit. Between the two lie
means—that is middle conditions:—acts to be
performed; difficulties to be overcome; appliances
to be used. Only through them, in the literal time
sense, will the initial activities reach a satisfactory
consummation.
These intermediate conditions are of interest
precisely because the development of existing
activities into the foreseen and desired end
depends upon them. To be means for the
achieving of present tendencies, to be "between"
the agent and his end, to be of interest, are
different names for the same thing. When
material has to be made interesting, it signifies
that as presented, it lacks connection with
purposes and present power: or that if the
connection be there, it is not perceived. To make it
interesting by leading one to realize the
connection that exists is simply good sense; to
make it interesting by extraneous and artificial
inducements deserves all the bad names which
have been applied to the doctrine of interest in
education.

4. The "Individualistic" Ideal of the Eighteenth
Century. In the eighteenth-century philosophy we
find ourselves in a very different circle of ideas.
"Nature" still means something antithetical to
existing social organization; Plato exercised a
great influence upon Rousseau. But the voice of
nature now speaks for the diversity of individual
talent and for the need of free development of
individuality in all its variety. Education in accord
with nature furnishes the goal and the method of
instruction and discipline. Moreover, the native or
original endowment was conceived, in extreme
cases, as nonsocial or even as antisocial. Social
arrangements were thought of as mere external
expedients by which these nonsocial individuals
might secure a greater amount of private
happiness for themselves. Nevertheless, these
statements convey only an inadequate idea of the
true significance of the movement. In reality its
chief interest was in progress and in social
progress. The seeming antisocial philosophy was
a somewhat transparent mask for an impetus
toward a wider and freer society—toward
cosmopolitanism. The positive ideal was
humanity. In membership in humanity, as distinct
from a state, man's capacities would be liberated;
while in existing political organizations his
powers were hampered and distorted to meet the
requirements and selfish interests of the rulers of</p><hr/><p>in the fact that we can use it to change conditions.
It is a method for dealing with conditions so as to
effect desirable alterations in them. A farmer who
should passively accept things just as he finds
them would make as great a mistake as he who
framed his plans in complete disregard of what
soil, climate, etc., permit. One of the evils of an
abstract or remote external aim in education is
that its very inapplicability in practice is likely to
react into a haphazard snatching at immediate
conditions. A good aim surveys the present state
of experience of pupils, and forming a tentative
plan of treatment, keeps the plan constantly in
view and yet modifies it as conditions develop.
The aim, in short, is experimental, and hence
constantly growing as it is tested in action.
(3) The aim must always represent a freeing of
activities. The term end in view is suggestive, for it
puts before the mind the termination or
conclusion of some process. The only way in
which we can define an activity is by putting
before ourselves the objects in which it
terminates—as one's aim in shooting is the target.
But we must remember that the object is only a
mark or sign by which the mind specifies the
activity one desires to carry out. Strictly speaking,
not the target but hitting the target is the end in
view; one takes aim by means of the target, but
also by the sight on the gun. The different objects
which are thought of are means of directing the</p><hr/><p>of intelligence in foresight, and contriving, is then
discounted; we are just to get out of the way and
allow nature to do the work. Since no one has
stated in the doctrine both its truth and falsity
better than Rousseau, we shall turn to him.
"Education," he says, "we receive from three
sources—Nature, men, and things. The
spontaneous development of our organs and
capacities constitutes the education of Nature. The
use to which we are taught to put this
development constitutes that education given us
by Men. The acquirement of personal experience
from surrounding objects constitutes that of
things. Only when these three kinds of education
are consonant and make for the same end, does a
man tend towards his true goal. If we are asked
what is this end, the answer is that of Nature. For
since the concurrence of the three kinds of
education is necessary to their completeness, the
kind which is entirely independent of our control
must necessarily regulate us in determining the
other two." Then he defines Nature to mean the
capacities and dispositions which are inborn, "as
they exist prior to the modification due to
constraining habits and the influence of the
opinion of others."
The wording of Rousseau will repay careful
study. It contains as fundamental truths as have
been uttered about education in conjunction with
a curious twist. It would be impossible to say</p><hr/><p>This is equivalent to saying that there is no
extensive number of common interests; there is
no free play back and forth among the members
of the social group. Stimulation and response are
exceedingly one-sided. In order to have a large
number of values in common, all the members of
the group must have an equable opportunity to
receive and to take from others. There must be a
large variety of shared undertakings and
experiences. Otherwise, the influences which
educate some into masters, educate others into
slaves. And the experience of each party loses in
meaning, when the free interchange of varying
modes of life-experience is arrested. A separation
into a privileged and a subject-class prevents
social endosmosis. The evils thereby affecting the
superior class are less material and less
perceptible, but equally real. Their culture tends
to be sterile, to be turned back to feed on itself;
their art becomes a showy display and artificial;
their wealth luxurious; their knowledge
overspecialized; their manners fastidious rather
than humane.
Lack of the free and equitable intercourse
which springs from a variety of shared interests
makes intellectual stimulation unbalanced.
Diversity of stimulation means novelty, and
novelty means challenge to thought. The more
activity is restricted to a few definite lines—as it is
when there are rigid class lines preventing</p><hr/><p>Our first question is to define the nature of an
aim so far as it falls within an activity, instead of
being furnished from without. We approach the
definition by a contrast of mere results with ends.
Any exhibition of energy has results. The wind
blows about the sands of the desert; the position
of the grains is changed. Here is a result, an effect,
but not an end. For there is nothing in the
outcome which completes or fulfills what went
before it. There is mere spatial redistribution. One
state of affairs is just as good as any other.
Consequently there is no basis upon which to
select an earlier state of affairs as a beginning, a
later as an end, and to consider what intervenes
as a process of transformation and realization.
Consider for example the activities of bees in
contrast with the changes in the sands when the
wind blows them about. The results of the bees’
actions may be called ends not because they are
designed or consciously intended, but because
they are true terminations or completions of what
has preceded. When the bees gather pollen and
make wax and build cells, each step prepares the
way for the next. When cells are built, the queen
lays eggs in them; when eggs are laid, they are
sealed and bees brood them and keep them at a
temperature required to hatch them. When they
are hatched, bees feed the young till they can take
care of themselves. Now we are so familiar with
such facts, that we are apt to dismiss them on the</p><hr/><p>The fuller one's conception of possible future
achievements, the less his present activity is tied
down to a small number of alternatives. If one
knew enough, one could start almost anywhere
and sustain his activities continuously and
fruitfully.
Understanding then the term general or
comprehensive aim simply in the sense of a broad
survey of the field of present activities, we shall
take up some of the larger ends which have
currency in the educational theories of the day,
and consider what light they throw upon the
immediate concrete and diversified aims which
are always the educator's real concern. We
premise (as indeed immediately follows from
what has been said) that there is no need of
making a choice among them or regarding them
as competitors. When we come to act in a tangible
‘way we have to select or choose a particular act
at a particular time, but any number of
comprehensive ends may exist without
competition, since they mean simply different
ways of looking at the same scene. One cannot
cimb a number of different mountains
simultaneously, but the views had when different
mountains are ascended supplement one another:
they do not set up incompatible, competing worlds.
Or, putting the matter in a slightly different way,
one statement of an end may suggest certain
questions and observations, and another</p><hr/><p>Such a separation could exist only if the
personal attitudes ran their course in a world by
themselves. But they are always responses to
what is going on in the situation of which they are
a part, and their successful or unsuccessful
expression depends upon their interaction with
other changes. Life activities flourish and fail only
in connection with changes of the environment.
They are literally bound up with these changes;
our desires, emotions, and affections are but
various ways in which our doings are tied up with
the doings of things and persons about us. Instead
of marking a purely personal or subjective realm,
separated from the objective and impersonal,
they indicate the non-existence of such a separate
world. They afford convincing evidence that
changes in things are not alien to the activities of
a self, and that the career and welfare of the self
are bound up with the movement of persons and
things. Interest, concern, mean that self and world
are engaged with each other in a developing
situation.
The word interest, in its ordinary usage,
expresses (i) the whole state of active
development, (ii) the objective results that are
foreseen and wanted, and (iii) the personal
emotional inclination.
(D An occupation, employment, pursuit,
business is often referred to as an interest. Thus
we say that a man's interest is politics, or</p><hr/><p>they are likely to do to him; and that, on the basis
of his expectation or foresight, he is eager to act so
as to give things one turn rather than another.
Interest and aims, concern and purpose, are
necessarily connected. Such words as aim, intent,
end, emphasize the results which are wanted and
striven for; they take for granted the personal
attitude of solicitude and attentive eagerness.
Such words as interest, affection, concern,
motivation, emphasize the bearing of what is
foreseen upon the individual's fortunes, and his
active desire to act to secure a possible result.
They take for granted the objective changes. But
the difference is but one of emphasis; the meaning
that is shaded in one set of words is illuminated in
the other. What is anticipated is objective and
impersonal; to-morrow's rain; the possibility of
being run over. But for an active being, a being
who partakes of the consequences instead of
standing aloof from them, there is at the same
time a personal response. The difference
imaginatively foreseen makes a present
difference, which finds expression in solicitude
and effort. While such words as affection, concern,
and motive indicate an attitude of personal
preference, they are always attitudes toward
objects—toward what is foreseen. We may call
the phase of objective foresight intellectual, and
the phase of personal concern emotional and
volitional, but there is no separation in the facts of
the situation.</p><hr/><p>Education. Interest represents the moving force of
objects—whether perceived or presented in
imagination—in any experience having a purpose.
In the concrete, the value of recognizing the
dynamic place of interest in an educative
development is that it leads to considering
individual children in their specific capabilities,
needs, and preferences. One who recognizes the
importance of interest will not assume that all
minds work in the same way because they
happen to have the same teacher and textbook.
Attitudes and methods of approach and response
vary with the specific appeal the same material
makes, this appeal itself varying with difference
of natural aptitude, of past experience, of plan of
life, and so on. But the facts of interest also supply
considerations of general value to the philosophy
of education. Rightly understood, they put us on
our guard against certain conceptions of mind
and of subject matter which have had great vogue
in philosophic thought in the past, and which
exercise a serious hampering influence upon the
conduct of instruction and discipline. Too
frequently mind is set over the world of things
and facts to be known; it is regarded as something
existing in isolation, with mental states and
operations that exist independently. Knowledge is
then regarded as an external application of purely
mental existences to the things to be known, or
else as a result of the impressions which this
outside subject matter makes on mind, or as a</p><hr/><p>from all inquiry. It has not been enough to show
that they were of no use in life or that they did not
really contribute to the cultivation of the self. That
they were "disciplinary" stifled every question,
subdued every doubt, and removed the subject
from the realm of rational discussion. By its
nature, the allegation could not be checked up.
Even when discipline did not accrue as matter of
fact, when the pupil even grew in laxity of
application and lost power of intelligent self-
direction, the fault lay with him, not with the
study or the methods of teaching. His failure was
but proof that he needed more discipline, and thus
afforded a reason for retaining the old methods.
The responsibility was transferred from the
educator to the pupil because the material did not
have to meet specific tests; it did not have to be
shown that it fulfilled any particular need or
served any specific end. It was designed to
discipline in general, and if it failed, it was because
the individual was unwilling to be disciplined. In
the other direction, the tendency was towards a
negative conception of discipline, instead of an
identification of it with growth in constructive
power of achievement. As we have already seen,
will means an attitude toward the future, toward
the production of possible consequences, an
attitude involving effort to foresee clearly and
comprehensively the probable results of ways of
acting, and an active identification with some
anticipated consequences. Identification of will, or</p><hr/><p>education, and the narrowly disciplinary or
cultural character of most higher education. It
accounts for the tendency to isolate intellectual
matters till knowledge is scholastic, academic, and
professionally technical, and for the widespread
conviction that liberal education is opposed to the
requirements of an education which shall count
in the vocations of life. But it also helps define the
peculiar problem of present education. The school
cannot immediately escape from the ideals set by
prior social conditions. But it should contribute
through the type of intellectual and emotional
disposition which it forms to the improvement of
those conditions. And just here the true
conceptions of interest and discipline are full of
significance. Persons whose interests have been
enlarged and intelligence trained by dealing with
things and facts in active occupations having a
purpose (whether in play or work) will be those
most likely to escape the alternatives of an
academic and aloof knowledge and a hard,
narrow, and merely “practical' practice. To
organize education so that natural active
tendencies shall be fully enlisted in doing
something, while seeing to it that the doing
requires observation, the acquisition of
information, and the use of a constructive
imagination, is what most needs to be done to
improve social conditions. To oscillate between
drill exercises that strive to attain efficiency in
outward doing without the use of intelligence. and</p><hr/><p>conscious or stated aim thus balance each other.
At different times such aims as complete living,
better methods of language study, substitution of
things for words, social efficiency, personal
culture, social service, complete development of
personality, encyclopedic knowledge, discipline, a
esthetic contemplation, utility, etc, have served.
The following discussion takes up three
statements of recent influence; certain others
have been incidentally discussed in the previous
chapters, and others will be considered later in a
discussion of knowledge and of the values of
studies. We begin with a consideration that
education is a process of development in
accordance with nature, taking Rousseau's
statement, which opposed natural to social (See
ante, p. 91); and then pass over to the antithetical
conception of social efficiency, which often
opposes social to natural.
(1) Educational reformers disgusted with the
conventionality and artificiality of the scholastic
methods they find about them are prone to resort
to nature as a standard. Nature is supposed to
furnish the law and the end of development; ours
it is to follow and conform to her ways. The
positive value of this conception lies in the forcible
way in which it calls attention to the wrongness
of aims which do not have regard to the natural
endowment of those educated. Its weakness is the
ease with which natural in the sense of normal is
confused with the physical. The constructive use</p><hr/><p>For the most part, save incidentally, we have
hitherto been concerned with education as it may
exist in any social group. We have now to make
explicit the differences in the spirit, material, and
method of education as it operates in different
types of community life. To say that education is a
social function, securing direction and
development in the immature through their
participation in the life of the group to which they
belong, is to say in effect that education will vary
with the quality of life which prevails in a group.
Particularly is it true that a society which not only
changes but-which has the ideal of such change as
will improve it, will have different standards and
methods of education from one which aims
simply at the perpetuation of its own customs. To
make the general ideas set forth applicable to our
own educational practice, it is, therefore,
necessary to come to closer quarters with the
nature of present social life.
1. The Implications of Human Association.
Society is one word, but many things. Men
associate together in all kinds of ways and for all
kinds of purposes. One man is concerned in a
multitude of diverse groups, in which his
associates may be quite different. It often seems
as if they had nothing in common except that they
are modes of associated life. Within every larger
social organization there are numerous minor
groups: not only political subdivisions, but</p><hr/><p>affairs, these are reduced to mere personal states
of pleasure or pain. Educationally, it then follows
that to attach importance to interest means to
attach some feature of seductiveness to material
otherwise indifferent; to secure attention and
effort by offering a bribe of pleasure. This
procedure is properly stigmatized as "soft"
pedagogy; as a "soup-kitchen" theory of education.
But the objection is based upon the fact—or
assumption—that the forms of skill to be acquired
and the subject matter to be appropriated have no
interest on their own account: in other words,
they are supposed to be irrelevant to the normal
activities of the pupils. The remedy is not in
finding fault with the doctrine of interest, any
more than it is to search for some pleasant bait
that may be hitched to the alien material. It is to
discover objects and modes of action, which are
connected with present powers. The function of
this material in engaging activity and carrying it
on consistently and continuously is its interest. If
the material operates in this way, there is no call
either to hunt for devices which will make it
interesting or to appeal to arbitrary, semi-coerced
effort.
The word interest suggests, etymologically,
‘what is between,—that which connects two things
otherwise distant. In education, the distance
covered may be looked at as temporal. The fact
that a process takes time to mature is so obvious a</p><hr/><p>perverting them—and supposing that they have a
normal development apart from any use, which
development furnishes the standard and norm of
all learning by use. To recur to our previous
illustration, the process of acquiring language is a
practically perfect model of proper educative
growth. The start is from native activities of the
vocal apparatus, organs of hearing, etc. But it is
absurd to suppose that these have an
independent growth of their own, which left to
itself would evolve a perfect speech. Taken
literally, Rousseau's principle would mean that
adults should accept and repeat the babblings and
noises of children not merely as the beginnings of
the development of articulate speech—which they
are—but as furnishing language itself—the
standard for all teaching of language.
The point may be summarized by saying that
Rousseau was right, introducing a much-needed
reform into education, in holding that the
structure and activities of the organs furnish the
conditions of all teaching of the use of the organs;
but profoundly wrong in intimating that they
supply not only the conditions but also the ends of
their development. As matter of fact, the native
activities develop, in contrast with random and
capricious exercise, through the uses to which
they are put. And the office of the social medium
is, as we have seen, to direct growth through
putting powers to the best possible use. The</p><hr/><p>1. The Meaning of the Terms. We have already
noticed the difference in the attitude of a spectator
and of an agent or participant. The former is
indifferent to what is going on; one result is just
as good as another, since each is just something to
look at. The latter is bound up with what is going
on; its outcome makes a difference to him. His
fortunes are more or less at stake in the issue of
events. Consequently he does whatever he can to
influence the direction present occurrences take.
One is like a man in a prison cell watching the
rain out of the window; it is all the same to him.
The other is like a man who has planned an
outing for the next day which continuing rain will
frustrate. He cannot, to be sure, by his present
reactions affect to-morrow's weather, but he may
take some steps which will influence future
happenings, if only to postpone the proposed
picnic. If a man sees a carriage coming which may
run over him, if he cannot stop its movement, he
can at least get out of the way if he foresees the
consequence in time. In many instances, he can
intervene even more directly. The attitude of a
participant in the course of affairs is thus a double
one: there is solicitude, anxiety concerning future
consequences, and a tendency to act to assure
better, and avert worse, consequences. There are
words which denote this attitude: concern,
interest. These words suggest that a person is
bound up with the possibilities inhering in objects;
that he is accordingly on the lookout for what</p><hr/><p>The whole attitude is one of concern with what is
to be, and with what is so far as the latter enters
into the movement toward the end. Leave out the
direction which depends upon foresight of
possible future results, and there is no intelligence
in present behavior. Let there be imaginative
forecast but no attention to the conditions upon
which its attainment depends, and there is self-
deception or idle dreaming—abortive intelligence.
If this illustration is typical, mind is not a name
for something complete by itself; it is a name for a
course of action in so far as that is intelligently
directed; in so far, that is to say, as aims, ends,
enter into it, with selection of means to further
the attainment of aims. Intelligence is not a
peculiar possession which a person owns; but a
person is intelligent in so far as the activities in
which he plays a part have the qualities
mentioned. Nor are the activities in which a
person engages, whether intelligently or not,
exclusive properties of himself; they are
something in which he engages and partakes.
Other things, the independent changes of other
things and persons, cooperate and hinder. The
individual's act may be initial in a course of
events, but the outcome depends upon the
interaction of his response with energies supplied
by other agencies. Conceive mind as anything but
one factor partaking along with others in the
production of consequences, and it becomes</p><hr/><p>their subjects as instruments of their own
purposes.
Who, then, shall conduct education so that
humanity may improve? We must depend upon
the efforts of enlightened men in their private
capacity. "All culture begins with private men and
spreads outward from them. Simply through the
efforts of persons of enlarged inclinations, who
are capable of grasping the ideal of a future better
condition, is the gradual approximation of human
nature to its end possible. Rulers are simply
interested in such training as will make their
subjects better tools for their own intentions."
Even the subsidy by rulers of privately conducted
schools must be carefully safeguarded. For the
rulers’ interest in the welfare of their own nation
instead of in what is best for humanity, will make
them, if they give money for the schools, wish to
draw their plans. We have in this view an express
statement of the points characteristic of the
eighteenth century individualistic
cosmopolitanism. The full development of private
personality is identified with the aims of
humanity as a whole and with the idea of
progress. In addition we have an explicit fear of
the hampering influence of a state-conducted and
state-regulated education upon the attainment of
these ideas. But in less than two decades after this
time, Kant's philosophic successors, Fichte and
Hegel, elaborated the idea that the chief function</p><hr/><p>Thus interest and mind are either narrowed, or
else made perverse. Compare what was said in an
earlier chapter about the one-sided meanings
which have come to attach to the ideas of
efficiency and of culture.
This state of affairs must exist so far as society
is organized on a basis of division between
laboring classes and leisure classes. The
intelligence of those who do things becomes hard
in the unremitting struggle with things; that of
those freed from the discipline of occupation
becomes luxurious and effeminate. Moreover, the
majority of human beings still lack economic
freedom. Their pursuits are fixed by accident and
necessity of circumstance; they are not the
normal expression of their own powers
interacting with the needs and resources of the
environment. Our economic conditions still
relegate many men to a servile status. As a
consequence, the intelligence of those in control of
the practical situation is not liberal. Instead of
playing freely upon the subjugation of the world
for human ends, it is devoted to the manipulation
of other men for ends that are non-human in so
far as they are exclusive.
This state of affairs explains many things in our
historic educational traditions. It throws light
upon the clash of aims manifested in different
portions of the school system; the narrowly
utilitarian character of most elementary</p><hr/><p>The problem of instruction is thus that of
finding material which will engage a person in
specific activities having an aim or purpose of
moment or interest to him, and dealing with
things not as gymnastic appliances but as
conditions for the attainment of ends. The remedy
for the evils attending the doctrine of formal
discipline previously spoken of, is not to be found
by substituting a doctrine of specialized
disciplines, but by reforming the notion of mind
and its training. Discovery of typical modes of
activity, whether play or useful occupations, in
which individuals are concerned, in whose
outcome they recognize they have something at
stake, and which cannot be carried through
without reflection and use of judgment to select
material of observation and recollection, is the
remedy. In short, the root of the error long
prevalent in the conception of training of mind
consists in leaving out of account movements of
things to future results in which an individual
shares, and in the direction of which observation,
imagination, and memory are enlisted. It consists
in regarding mind as complete in itself, ready to
be directly applied to a present material.
In historic practice the error has cut two ways.
On one hand, it has screened and protected
traditional studies and methods of teaching from
intelligent criticism and needed revisions. To say
that they are "disciplinary" has safeguarded them</p><hr/><p>The account of education given in our earlier
chapters virtually anticipated the results reached
in a discussion of the purport of education in a
democratic community. For it assumed that the
aim of education is to enable individuals to
continue their education—or that the object and
reward of learning is continued capacity for
growth. Now this idea cannot be applied to all the
members of a society except where intercourse of
man with man is mutual, and except where there
is adequate provision for the reconstruction of
social habits and institutions by means of wide
stimulation arising from equitably distributed
interests. And this means a democratic society. In
our search for aims in education, we are not
concerned, therefore, with finding an end outside
of the educative process to which education is
subordinate. Our whole conception forbids. We
are rather concerned with the contrast which
exists when aims belong within the process in
which they operate and when they are set up
from without. And the latter state of affairs must
obtain when social relationships are not equitably
balanced. For in that case, some portions of the
whole social group will find their aims
determined by an external dictation; their aims
will not arise from the free growth of their own
experience, and their nominal aims will be means
to more ulterior ends of others rather than truly
their own.</p><hr/><p>not there; neither can the educator. In this sense,
heredity is a limit of education. Recognition of this
fact prevents the waste of energy and the
irritation that ensue from the too prevalent habit
of trying to make by instruction something out of
an individual which he is not naturally fitted to
become. But the doctrine does not determine what
use shall be made of the capacities which exist.
And, except in the case of the imbecile, these
original capacities are much more varied and
potential, even in the case of the more stupid,
than we as yet know properly how to utilize.
Consequently, while a careful study of the native
aptitudes and deficiencies of an individual is
always a preliminary necessity, the subsequent
and important step is to furnish an environment
which will adequately function whatever
activities are present. The relation of heredity and
environment is well expressed in the case of
language. If a being had no vocal organs from
which issue articulate sounds, if he had no
auditory or other sensereceptors and no
connections between the two sets of apparatus, it
‘would be a sheer waste of time to try to teach him
to converse. He is born short in that respect, and
education must accept the limitation. But if he has
this native equipment, its possession in no way
guarantees that he will ever talk any language or
what language he will talk. The environment in
which his activities occur and by which they are
carried into execution settles these things. If he</p><hr/><p>assimilation of new presentations, their character
is all important. The effect of new presentations is
to reinforce groupings previously formed. The
business of the educator is, first, to select the
proper material in order to fix the nature of the
original reactions, and, secondly, to arrange the
sequence of subsequent presentations on the
basis of the store of ideas secured by prior
transactions. The control is from behind, from the
past, instead of, as in the unfolding conception, in
the ultimate goal.
(3) Certain formal steps of all method in
teaching may be laid down. Presentation of new
subject matter is obviously the central thing, but
since knowing consists in the way in which this
interacts with the contents already submerged
below consciousness, the first thing is the step of
"preparation,"—that is, calling into special activity
and getting above the floor of consciousness those
older presentations which are to assimilate the
new one. Then after the presentation, follow the
processes of interaction of new and old; then
comes the application of the newly formed
content to the performance of some task.
Everything must go through this course;
consequently there is a perfectly uniform method
in instruction in all subjects for all pupils of all
ages.
Herbart's great service lay in taking the work of
teaching out of the region of routine and accident.</p><hr/><p>perception, even the sentiments, are
arrangements, associations, and complications,
formed by the interaction of these submerged
presentations with one another and with new
presentations. Perception, for example, is the
complication of presentations which result from
the rise of old presentations to greet and combine
with new ones; memory is the evoking of an old
presentation above the threshold of
consciousness by getting entangled with another
presentation, etc. Pleasure is the result of
reinforcement among the independent activities
of presentations; pain of their pulling different
ways, etc.
The concrete character of mind consists, then,
wholly of the various arrangements formed by
the various presentations in their different
qualities. The "furniture" of the mind is the mind.
Mind is wholly a matter of "contents." The
educational implications of this doctrine are
threefold.
(1) This or that kind of mind is formed by the
use of objects which evoke this or that kind of
reaction and which produce this or that
arrangement among the reactions called out. The
formation of mind is wholly a matter of the
presentation of the proper educational materials.
(2) Since the earlier presentations constitute the
"apperceiving organs" which control the</p><hr/><p>intellectual opportunities are accessible to all on
equable and easy terms. A society marked off into
classes need he specially attentive only to the
education of its ruling elements. A society which is
mobile, which is full of channels for the
distribution of a change occurring anywhere,
must see to it that its members are educated to
personal initiative and adaptability. Otherwise,
they will be overwhelmed by the changes in
which they are caught and whose significance or
connections they do not perceive. The result will
be a confusion in which a few will appropriate to
themselves the results of the blind and externally
directed activities of others.
3. The Platonic Educational Philosophy.
Subsequent chapters will be devoted to making
explicit the implications of the democratic ideas in
education. In the remaining portions of this
chapter, we shall consider the educational
theories which have been evolved in three epochs
when the social import of education was
especially conspicuous. The first one to be
considered is that of Plato. No one could better
express than did he the fact that a society is stably
organized when each individual is doing that for
which he has aptitude by nature in such a way as
to be useful to others (or to contribute to the
whole to which he belongs); and that it is the
business of education to discover these aptitudes
and progressively to train them for social use.</p><hr/><p>distinctive temperament. We indiscriminately
employ children of different bents on the same
exercises; their education destroys the special
bent and leaves a dull uniformity. Therefore after
we have wasted our efforts in stunting the true
gifts of nature we see the short-lived and illusory
brilliance we have substituted die away, while the
natural abilities we have crushed do not revive."
Lastly, the aim of following nature means to
note the origin, the waxing, and waning, of
preferences and interests. Capacities bud and
bloom irregularly; there is no even four-abreast
development. We must strike while the iron is hot.
Especially precious are the first dawnings of
power. More than we imagine, the ways in which
the tendencies of early childhood are treated fix
fundamental dispositions and condition the turn
taken by powers that show themselves later.
Educational concern with the early years of life—
as distinct from inculcation of useful arts—dates
almost entirely from the time of the emphasis by
Pestalozzi and Froebel, following Rousseau, of
natural principles of growth. The irregularity of
growth and its significance is indicated in the
following passage of a student of the growth of
the nervous system. "While growth continues,
things bodily and mental are lopsided, for growth
is never general, but is accentuated now at one
spot, now at another. The methods which shall
recognize in the presence of these enormous</p><hr/><p>1. Nature as Supplying the Aim. We have just
pointed out the futility of trying to establish the
aim of education—some one final aim which
subordinates all others to itself. We have
indicated that since general aims are but
prospective points of view from which to survey
the existing conditions and estimate their
possibilities, we might have any number of them,
all consistent with one another. As matter of fact,
a large number have been stated at different
times, all having great local value. For the
statement of aim is a matter of emphasis at a
given time. And we do not emphasize things
which do not require emphasis—that is, such
things as are taking care of themselves fairly well.
We tend rather to frame our statement on the
basis of the defects and needs of the
contemporary situation; we take for granted,
without explicit statement which would be of no
use, whatever is right or approximately so. We
frame our explicit aims in terms of some
alteration to be brought about. It is, then, DO
paradox requiring explanation that a given epoch
or generation tends to emphasize in its conscious
projections just the things which it has least of in
actual fact. A time of domination by authority will
call out as response the desirability of great
individual freedom; one of disorganized
individual activities the need of social control as
an educational aim.
The actual and implicit practice and the</p><hr/><p>least the merit of protecting us from the notion of
a training of mental power at large. It calls
attention to the fact that power must be relative
to doing something, and to the fact that the things
which most need to be done are things which
involve one's relationships with others.
Here again we have to be on guard against
understanding the aim too narrowly. An over-
definite interpretation would at certain periods
have excluded scientific discoveries, in spite of the
fact that in the last analysis security of social
progress depends upon them. For scientific men
‘would have been thought to be mere theoretical
dreamers, totally lacking in social efficiency. It
must be borne in mind that ultimately social
efficiency means neither more nor less than
capacity to share in a give and take of experience.
It covers all that makes one's own experience
more worth while to others, and all that enables
one to participate more richly in the worthwhile
experiences of others. Ability to produce and to
enjoy art, capacity for recreation, the significant
utilization of leisure, are more important
elements in it than elements conventionally
associated oftentimes with citizenship. In the
broadest sense, social efficiency is nothing less
than that socialization of mind which is actively
concerned in making experiences more
communicable; in breaking down the barriers of
social stratification which make individuals
impervious to the interests of others. When social</p><hr/><p>external; they are shifting things about. No ideal
reward, no enrichment of emotion and intellect,
accompanies them. Others contribute to the
maintenance of life, and to its external adornment
and display. Many of our existing social activities,
industrial and political, fall in these two classes.
Neither the people who engage in them, nor those
who are directly affected by them, are capable of
full and free interest in their work. Because of the
lack of any purpose in the work for the one doing
it, or because of the restricted character of its aim,
intelligence is not adequately engaged. The same
conditions force many people back upon
themselves. They take refuge in an inner play of
sentiment and fancies. They are aesthetic but not
artistic, since their feelings and ideas are turned
upon themselves, instead of being methods in acts
which modify conditions. Their mental life is
sentimental; an enjoyment of an inner landscape.
Even the pursuit of science may become an
asylum of refuge from the hard conditions of life—
not a temporary retreat for the sake of
recuperation and clarification in future dealings
with the world. The very word art may become
associated not with specific transformation of
things, making them more significant for mind,
but with stimulations of eccentric fancy and with
emotional indulgences. The separation and
mutual contempt of the “practical” man and the
man of theory or culture, the divorce of fine and
industrial arts, are indications of this situation.</p><hr/><p>enormous difference between availing ourselves
of them as present resources and taking them as
standards and patterns in their retrospective
character.
(1) The distortion of the first point usually
comes about through misuse of the idea of
heredity. It is assumed that heredity means that
past life has somehow predetermined the main
traits of an individual, and that they are so fixed
that little serious change can be introduced into
them. Thus taken, the influence of heredity is
opposed to that of the environment, and the
efficacy of the latter belittled. But for educational
purposes heredity means neither more nor less
than the original endowment of an individual
Education must take the being as he is; that a
particular individual has just such and such an
equipment of native activities is a basic fact. That
they were produced in such and such a way, or
that they are derived from one's ancestry, is not
especially important for the educator, however it
may be with the biologist, as compared with the
fact that they now exist. Suppose one had to
advise or direct a person regarding his
inheritance of property. The fallacy of assuming
that the fact it is an inheritance, predetermines its
future use, is obvious. The advisor is concerned
with making the best use of what is there—
putting it at work under the most favorable
conditions. Obviously he cannot utilize what is</p><hr/><p>accomplishment of our purposes depends. Stated
thus broadly, the formula may appear abstract.
Translated into details, it means that the act of
learning or studying is artificial and ineffective in
the degree in which pupils are merely presented
with a lesson to be learned. Study is effectual in
the degree in which the pupil realizes the place of
the numerical truth he is dealing with in carrying
to fruition activities in which he is concerned. This
connection of an object and a topic with the
promotion of an activity having a purpose is the
first and the last word of a genuine theory of
interest in education.
3. Some Social Aspects of the Question. While
the theoretical errors of which we have been
speaking have their expressions in the conduct of
schools, they are themselves the outcome of
conditions of social life. A change confined to the
theoretical conviction of educators will not
remove the difficulties, though it should render
more effective efforts to modify social conditions.
Men's fundamental attitudes toward the world
are fixed by the scope and qualities of the
activities in which they partake. The ideal of
interest is exemplified in the artistic attitude. Art
is neither merely internal nor merely external;
merely mental nor merely physical. Like every
mode of action, it brings about changes in the
world. The changes made by some actions (those
which by contrast may be called mechanical) are</p><hr/><p>"Nature" may be said to utter is that there are
conditions of educational efficiency, and that till
we have learned what these conditions are and
have learned to make our practices accord with
them, the noblest and most ideal of our aims are
doomed to suffer—are verbal and sentimental
rather than efficacious.
(2) The aim of natural development translates
into the aim of respect for physical mobility. In
Rousseau's words: "Children are always in
motion; a sedentary life is injurious." When he
says that "Nature's intention is to strengthen the
body before exercising the mind" he hardly states
the fact fairly. But if he had said that nature's
"intention" (to adopt his poetical form of speech) is
to develop the mind especially by exercise of the
muscles of the body he would have stated a
positive fact. In other words, the aim of following
nature means, in the concrete, regard for the
actual part played by use of the bodily organs in
explorations, in handling of materials, in plays
and games. (3) The general aim translates into the
aim of regard for individual differences among
children. Nobody can take the principle of
consideration of native powers into account
without being struck by the fact that these powers
differ in different individuals. The difference
applies not merely to their intensity, but even
more to their quality and arrangement. As
Rouseau said: "Each individual is born with a</p><hr/><p>contact with other modes of association.
I Let us apply the first element in this criterion
to a despotically governed state. It is not true
there is no common interest in such an
organization between governed and governors.
The authorities in command must make some
appeal to the native activities of the subjects, must
call some of their powers into play. Talleyrand
said that a government could do everything with
bayonets except sit on them. This cynical
declaration is at least a recognition that the bond
of union is not merely one of coercive force. It
may be said, however, that the activities appealed
to are themselves unworthy and degrading—that
such a government calls into functioning activity
simply capacity for fear. In a way, this statement
is true. But it overlooks the fact that fear need not
be an undesirable factor in experience. Caution,
circumspection, prudence, desire to foresee future
events so as to avert what is harmful, these
desirable traits are as much a product of calling
the impulse of fear into play as is cowardice and
abject submission. The real difficulty is that the
appeal to fear is isolated. In evoking dread and
hope of specific tangible reward—say comfort and
ease—many other capacities are left untouched.
Or rather, they are affected, but in such a way as
to pervert them. Instead of operating on their own
account they are reduced to mere servants of
attaining pleasure and avoiding pain.</p><hr/><p>better what is said in the first sentences. The three
factors of educative development are (a) the
native structure of our bodily organs and their
functional activities; (b) the uses to which the
activities of these organs are put under the
influence of other persons; (c) their direct
interaction with the environment. This statement
certainly covers the ground. His other two
propositions are equally sound; namely, (a) that
only when the three factors of education are
consonant and cooperative does adequate
development of the individual occur, and (b) that
the native activities of the organs, being original,
are basic in conceiving consonance. But it
requires but little reading between the lines,
supplemented by other statements of Rousseau,
to perceive that instead of regarding these three
things as factors which must work together to
some extent in order that any one of them may
proceed educatively, he regards them as separate
and independent operations. Especially does he
believe that there is an independent and, as he
says, "spontaneous" development of the native
organs and faculties. He thinks that this
development can go on irrespective of the use to
which they are put. And it is to this separate
development that education coming from social
contact is to be subordinated. Now there is an
immense difference between a use of native
activities in accord with those activities
themselves—as distinct from forcing them and</p><hr/><p>what we are about; conscious signifies the
deliberate, observant, planning traits of activity.
Consciousness is nothing which we have which
gazes idly on the scene around one or which has
impressions made upon it by physical things; it is
a name for the purposeful quality of an activity,
for the fact that it is directed by an aim. Put the
other way about, to have an aim is to act with
meaning, not like an automatic machine; it is to
mean to do something and to perceive the
meaning of things in the light of that intent.
2. The Criteria of Good Aims. We may apply the
results of our discussion to a consideration of the
criteria involved in a correct establishing of aims.
(1) The aim set up must be an outgrowth of
existing conditions. It must be based upon a
consideration of what is already going on; upon
the resources and difficulties of the situation.
Theories about the proper end of our activities—
educational and moral theories—often violate
this principle. They assume ends lying outside our
activities; ends foreign to the concrete makeup of
the situation; ends which issue from some outside
source. Then the problem is to bring our activities
to bear upon the realization of these externally
supplied ends. They are something for which we
ought to act. In any case such "aims" limit
intelligence; they are not the expression of mind
in foresight, observation, and choice of the better
among alternative possibilities. They limit</p><hr/><p>develops, but his proper development consists in
repeating in orderly stages the past evolution of
animal life and human history. The former
recapitulation occurs physiologically; the latter
should be made to occur by means of education.
The alleged biological truth that the individual in
his growth from the simple embryo to maturity
repeats the history of the evolution of animal life
in the progress of forms from the simplest to the
most complex (or expressed technically, that
ontogenesis parallels phylogenesis) does not
concern us, save as it is supposed to afford
scientific foundation for cultural recapitulation of
the past. Cultural recapitulation says, first, that
children at a certain age are in the mental and
moral condition of savagery; their instincts are
vagrant and predatory because their ancestors at
one time lived such a life. Consequently (so it is
concluded) the proper subject matter of their
education at this time is the material—especially
the literary material of myths, folk-tale, and
song—produced by humanity in the analogous
stage. Then the child passes on to something
corresponding, say, to the pastoral stage, and so
on till at the time when he is ready to take part in
contemporary life, he arrives at the present epoch
of culture.
In this detailed and consistent form, the theory,
outside of a small school in Germany (followers of
Herbart for the most part), has had little currency.</p><hr/><p>thoroughgoing "disciplinary" subordination to
existing institutions. The extent of the
transformation of educational philosophy which
occurred in Germany in the generation occupied
by the struggle against Napoleon for national
independence, may be gathered from Kant, who
well expresses the earlier individual-
cosmopolitan ideal. In his treatise on Pedagogics,
consisting of lectures given in the later years of
the eighteenth century, he defines education as
the process by which man becomes man.
Mankind begins its history submerged in nature—
not as Man who is a creature of reason, while
nature furnishes only instinct and appetite.
Nature offers simply the germs which education
is to develop and perfect. The peculiarity of truly
human life is that man has to create himself by
his own voluntary efforts; he has to make himself
a truly moral, rational, and free being. This
creative effort is carried on by the educational
activities of slow generations. Its acceleration
depends upon men consciously striving to educate
their successors not for the existing state of
affairs but so as to make possible a future better
humanity. But there is the great difficulty. Each
generation is inclined to educate its young so as to
get along in the present world instead of with a
view to the proper end of education: the
promotion of the best possible realization of
humanity as humanity. Parents educate their
children so that they may get on; princes educate</p><hr/><p>because after the act is performed we note results
which we had not noted before. But much work in
school consists in setting up rules by which pupils
are to act of such a sort that even after pupils
have acted, they are not led to see the connection
between the result—say the answer—and the
method pursued. So far as they are concerned, the
whole thing is a trick and a kind of miracle. Such
action is essentially capricious, and leads to
capricious habits. (b) Routine action, action which
is automatic, may increase skill to do a particular
thing. In so far, it might be said to have an
educative effect. But it does not lead to new
perceptions of bearings and connections; it limits
rather than widens the meaning-horizon. And
since the environment changes and our way of
acting has to be modified in order successfully to
keep a balanced connection with things, an
isolated uniform way of acting becomes
disastrous at some critical moment. The vaunted
"skill" turns out gross ineptitude.
The essential contrast of the idea of education
as continuous reconstruction with the other one-
sided conceptions which have been criticized in
this and the previous chapter is that it identifies
the end (the result) and the process. This is
verbally self-contradictory, but only verbally. It
means that experience as an active process
occupies time and that its later period completes
its earlier portion; it brings to light connections</p><hr/><p>But the idea which underlies it is that education is
essentially retrospective; that it looks primarily to
the past and especially to the literary products of
the past, and that mind is adequately formed in
the degree in which it is patterned upon the
spiritual heritage of the past. This idea has had
such immense influence upon higher instruction
especially, that it is worth examination in its
extreme formulation.
In the first place, its biological basis is fallacious.
Embyronic growth of the human infant preserves,
without doubt, some of the traits of lower forms
of life. But in no respect is it a strict traversing of
past stages. If there were any strict "law" of
repetition, evolutionary development would
clearly not have taken place. Each new
generation would simply have repeated its
predecessors’ existence. Development, in short,
has taken place by the entrance of shortcuts and
alterations in the prior scheme of growth. And
this suggests that the aim of education is to
facilitate such short-circuited growth. The great
advantage of immaturity, educationally speaking,
is that it enables us to emancipate the young from
the need of dwelling in an outgrown past. The
business of education is rather to liberate the
young from reviving and retraversing the past
than to lead them to a recapitulation of it. The
social environment of the young is constituted by
the presence and action of the habits of thinking</p><hr/><p>fail to call out a protest. The opposing emphasis
took the form of a doctrine that the business of
education is to supply precisely what nature fails
to secure; namely, habituation of an individual to
social control; subordination of natural powers to
social rules. It is not surprising to find that the
value in the idea of social efficiency resides
largely in its protest against the points at which
the doctrine of natural development went astray;
while its misuse comes when it is employed to
slur over the truth in that conception. It is a fact
that we must look to the activities and
achievements of associated life to find what the
development of power—that is to say, efficiency—
means. The error is in implying that we must
adopt measures of subordination rather than of
utilization to secure efficiency. The doctrine is
rendered adequate when we recognize that social
efficiency is attained not by negative constraint
but by positive use of native individual capacities
in occupations having a social meaning. (1)
Translated into specific aims, social efficiency
indicates the importance of industrial competency.
Persons cannot live without means of subsistence;
the ways in which these means are employed and
consumed have a profound influence upon all the
relationships of persons to one another. If an
individual is not able to earn his own living and
that of the children dependent upon him, he is a
drag or parasite upon the activities of others. He
misses for himself one of the most educative</p><hr/><p>suggest improvement. Now in any social group
whatever, even in a gang of thieves, we find some
interest held in common, and we find a certain
amount of interaction and cooperative
intercourse with other groups. From these two
traits we derive our standard. How numerous
and varied are the interests which are
consciously shared? How full and free is the
interplay with other forms of association? If we
apply these considerations to, say, a criminal band,
we find that the ties which consciously hold the
members together are few in number, reducible
almost to a common interest in plunder; and that
they are of such a nature as to isolate the group
from other groups with respect to give and take of
the values of life. Hence, the education such a
society gives is partial and distorted. If we take, on
the other hand, the kind of family life which
illustrates the standard, we find that there are
material, intellectual, aesthetic interests in which
all participate and that the progress of one
member has worth for the experience of other
members—it is readily communicable—and that
the family is not an isolated whole, but enters
intimately into relationships with business groups,
with schools, with all the agencies of culture, as
well as with other similar groups, and that it plays
a due part in the political organization and in
return receives support from it. In short, there are
many interests consciously communicated and
shared; and there are varied and free points of</p><hr/><p>1. Education as Formation. We now come to a
type of theory which denies the existence of
faculties and emphasizes the unique role of
subject matter in the development of mental and
moral disposition. According to it, education is
neither a process of unfolding from within nor is
it a training of faculties resident in mind itself. It is
rather the formation of mind by setting up certain
associations or connections of content by means
of a subject matter presented from without.
Education proceeds by instruction taken in a
strictly literal sense, a building into the mind from
without. That education is formative of mind is
not questioned; it is the conception already
propounded. But formation here has a technical
meaning dependent upon the idea of something
operating from without. Herbart is the best
historical representative of this type of theory. He
denies absolutely the existence of innate faculties.
The mind is simply endowed with the power of
producing various qualities in reaction to the
various realities which act upon it. These
qualitatively different reactions are called
presentations (Vorstellungen). Every presentation
once called into being persists; it may be driven
below the "threshold" of consciousness by new
and stronger presentations, produced by the
reaction of the soul to new material, but its
activity continues by its own inherent momentum,
below the surface of consciousness. What are
termed faculties—attention, memory, thinking,</p><hr/><p>who participate in an interest so that each has to
refer his own action to that of others, and to
consider the action of others to give point and
direction to his own, is equivalent to the breaking
down of those barriers of class, race, and national
territory which kept men from perceiving the full
import of their activity. These more numerous
and more varied points of contact denote a
greater diversity of stimuli to which an individual
has to respond; they consequently put a premium
on variation in his action. They secure a liberation
of powers which remain suppressed as long as
the incitations to action are partial, as they must
be in a group which in its exclusiveness shuts out
many interests.
The widening of the area of shared concerns,
and the liberation of a greater diversity of
personal capacities which characterize a
democracy, are not of course the product of
deliberation and conscious effort. On the contrary,
they were caused by the development of modes of
manufacture and commerce, travel, migration,
and intercommunication which flowed from the
command of science over natural energy. But
after greater individualization on one hand, and a
broader community of interest on the other have
come into existence, it is a matter of deliberate
effort to sustain and extend them. Obviously a
society to which stratification into separate
classes would be fatal, must see to it that</p><hr/><p>indifferently and miscellaneously to any and
every detail. It is centered upon whatever has a
bearing upon the effective pursuit of your
occupation. Your look is ahead, and you are
concerned to note the existing facts because and
in so far as they are factors in the achievement of
the result intended. You have to find out what
your resources are, what conditions are at
command, and what the difficulties and obstacles
are. This foresight and this survey with reference
to what is foreseen constitute mind. Action that
does not involve such a forecast of results and
such an examination of means and hindrances is
either a matter of habit or else it is blind. In
neither case is it intelligent. To be vague and
uncertain as to what is intended and careless in
observation of conditions of its realization is to be,
in that degree, stupid or partially intelligent.
If we recur to the case where mind is not
concerned with the physical manipulation of the
instruments but with what one intends to write,
the case is the same. There is an activity in
process; one is taken up with the development of
a theme. Unless one writes as a phonograph talks,
this means intelligence; namely, alertness in
foreseeing the various conclusions to which
present data and considerations are tending,
together with continually renewed observation
and recollection to get hold of the subject matter
which bears upon the conclusions to be reached.</p><hr/><p>one such group of facts; algebra another;
geography another, and so on till we have run
through the entire curriculum. Having a ready-
made existence on their own account, their
relation to mind is exhausted in what they
furnish it to acquire. This idea corresponds to the
conventional practice in which the program of
school work, for the day, month, and successive
years, consists of "studies" all marked off from
one another, and each supposed to be complete by
itself—for educational purposes at least.
Later on a chapter is devoted to the special
consideration of the meaning of the subject
matter of instruction. At this point, we need only
to say that, in contrast with the traditional theory,
anything which intelligence studies represents
things in the part which they play in the carrying
forward of active lines of interest. Just as one
"studies" his typewriter as part of the operation of
putting it to use to effect results, so with any fact
or truth. It becomes an object of study—that is, of
inquiry and reflection—when it figures as a factor
to be reckoned with in the completion of a course
of events in which one is engaged and by whose
outcome one is affected. Numbers are not objects
of study just because they are numbers already
constituting a branch of learning called
mathematics, but because they represent qualities
and relations of the world in which our action
goes on, because they are factors upon which the</p><hr/><p>following nature was a political dogma. It meant a
rebellion against existing social institutions,
customs, and ideals (See ante, p. 91). Rousseau's
statement that everything is good as it comes
from the hands of the Creator has its signification
only in its contrast with the concluding part of the
same sentence: "Everything degenerates in the
hands of man.” And again he says: "Natural man
has an absolute value; he is a numerical unit, a
complete integer and has no relation save to
himself and to his fellow man. Civilized man is
only a relative unit, the numerator of a fraction
whose value depends upon its dominator, its
relation to the integral body of society. Good
political institutions are those which make a man
unnatural.” It is upon this conception of the
artificial and harmful character of organized
social life as it now exists 2 that he rested the
notion that nature not merely furnishes prime
forces which initiate growth but also its plan and
goal. That evil institutions and customs work
almost automatically to give a wrong education
which the most careful schooling cannot offset is
true enough; but the conclusion is not to
education apart from the environment, but to
provide an environment in which native powers
will be put to better uses.
2. Social Efficiency as Aim. A conception which
made nature supply the end of a true education
and society the end of an evil one, could hardly</p><hr/><p>experience at the time and those in which they
are taught to acquiesce. Until the democratic
criterion of the intrinsic significance of every
growing experience is recognized, we shall be
intellectually confused by the demand for
adaptation to external aims.
(3) Educators have to be on their guard against
ends that are alleged to be general and ultimate.
Every activity, however specific, is, of course,
general in its ramified connections, for it leads out
indefinitely into other things. So far as a general
idea makes us more alive to these connections, it
cannot be too general. But "general" also means
"abstract," or detached from all specific context.
And such abstractness means remoteness, and
throws us back, once more, upon teaching and
learning as mere means of getting ready for an
end disconnected from the means. That education
is literally and all the time its own reward means
that no alleged study or discipline is educative
unless it is worth while in its own immediate
having. A truly general aim broadens the outlook;
it stimulates one to take more consequences
(connections) into account. This means a wider
and more flexible observation of means. The
more interacting forces, for example, the farmer
takes into account, the more varied will be his
immediate resources. He will see a greater
number of possible starting places, and a greater
number of ways of getting at what he wants to do.</p><hr/><p>Consequently an attempt to train for too specific a
mode of efficiency defeats its own purpose. When
the occupation changes its methods, such
individuals are left behind with even less ability to
readjust themselves than if they had a less
definite training. But, most of all, the present
industrial constitution of society is, like every
society which has ever existed, full of inequities. It
is the aim of progressive education to take part in
correcting unfair privilege and unfair deprivation,
not to perpetuate them. Wherever social control
means subordination of individual activities to
class authority, there is danger that industrial
education will be dominated by acceptance of the
status quo. Differences of economic opportunity
then dictate what the future callings of
individuals are to be. We have an unconscious
revival of the defects of the Platonic scheme (ante,
p- 89) without its enlightened method of selection.
(2) Civic efficiency, or good citizenship. It is, of
course, arbitrary to separate industrial
competency from capacity in good citizenship. But
the latter term may be used to indicate a number
of qualifications which are vaguer than
vocational ability. These traits run from whatever
make an individual a more agreeable companion
to citizenship in the political sense: it denotes
ability to judge men and measures wisely and to
take a determining part in making as well as
obeying laws. The aim of civic efficiency has at</p><hr/><p>combination of the two. Subject matter is then
regarded as something complete in itself, it is just
something to be learned or known, either by the
voluntary application of mind to it or through the
impressions it makes on mind.
The facts of interest show that these
conceptions are mythical. Mind appears in
experience as ability to respond to present stimuli
on the basis of anticipation of future possible
consequences, and with a view to controlling the
kind of consequences that are to take place. The
things, the subject matter known, consist of
whatever is recognized as having a bearing upon
the anticipated course of events, whether
assisting or retarding it. These statements are too
formal to be very intelligible. An illustration may
clear up their significance. You are engaged in a
certain occupation, say writing with a typewriter.
If you are an expert, your formed habits take care
of the physical movements and leave your
thoughts free to consider your topic. Suppose,
however, you are not skilled, or that, even if you
are, the machine does not work well. You then
have to use intelligence. You do not wish to strike
the keys at random and let the consequences be
what they may; you wish to record certain words
in a given order so as to make sense. You attend to
the keys, to what you have written, to your
movements, to the ribbon or the mechanism of
the machine. Your attention is not distributed</p><hr/><p>Seeds sprout, rain falls, the sun shines, insects
devour, blight comes, the seasons change. His aim
is simply to utilize these various conditions; to
make his activities and their energies work
together, instead of against one another. It would
be absurd if the farmer set up a purpose of
farming, without any reference to these
conditions of soil, climate, characteristic of plant
growth, etc. His purpose is simply a foresight of
the consequences of his energies connected with
those of the things about him, a foresight used to
direct his movements from day to day. Foresight
of possible consequences leads to more careful
and extensive observation of the nature and
performances of the things he had to do with, and
to laying out a plan—that is, of a certain order in
the acts to be performed.
It is the same with the educator, whether
parent or teacher. It is as absurd for the latter to
set up his "own" aims as the proper objects of the
growth of the children as it would be for the
farmer to set up an ideal of farming irrespective
of conditions. Aims mean acceptance of
responsibility for the observations, anticipations,
and arrangements required in carrying on a
function—whether farming or educating. Any aim
is of value so far as it assists observation, choice,
and planning in carrying on activity from
moment to moment and hour to hour; if it gets in
the way of the individual's own common sense
(as it will surelv do if imposed from without or</p><hr/><p>surrounded by other competing and more or less
hostile states, it was equally impossible to
interpret social efficiency in terms of a vague
cosmopolitan ~~ humanitarianism. Since the
maintenance of a particular national sovereignty
required subordination of individuals to the
superior interests of the state both in military
defense and in struggles for international
supremacy in commerce, social efficiency was
understood to imply a like subordination. The
educational process was taken to be one of
disciplinary training rather than of personal
development. Since, however, the ideal of culture
as complete development of personality persisted,
educational philosophy attempted a reconciliation
of the two ideas. The reconciliation took the form
of the conception of the "organic" character of the
state. The individual in his isolation is nothing;
only in and through an absorption of the aims
and meaning of organized institutions does he
attain true personality. What appears to be his
subordination to political authority and the
demand for sacrifice of himself to the commands
of his superiors is in reality but making his own
the objective reason manifested in the state—the
only way in which he can become truly rational.
The notion of development which we have seen to
be characteristic of institutional idealism (as in
the Hegelian philosophy) was just such a
deliberate effort to combine the two ideas of
complete realization of personality and</p><hr/><p>control. To say that one knows what he is about,
or can intend certain consequences, is to say, of
course, that he can better anticipate what is going
to happen; that he can, therefore, get ready or
prepare in advance so as to secure beneficial
consequences and avert undesirable ones. A
genuinely educative experience, then, one in
which instruction is conveyed and ability
increased, is contradistinguished from a routine
activity on one hand, and a capricious activity on
the other. (a) In the latter one "does not care what
happens"; one just lets himself go and avoids
connecting the consequences of one's act (the
evidences of its connections with other things)
with the act. It is customary to frown upon such
aimless random activity, treating it as willful
mischief or carelessness or lawlessness. But there
is a tendency to seek the cause of such aimless
activities in the youth's own disposition, isolated
from everything else. But in fact such activity is
explosive, and due to maladjustment with
surroundings. Individuals act capriciously
whenever they act under external dictation, or
from being told, without having a purpose of their
own or perceiving the bearing of the deed upon
other acts. One may learn by doing something
‘which he does not understand; even in the most
intelligent action, we do much which we do not
mean, because the largest portion of the
connections of the act we consciously intend are
not perceived or anticipated. But we learn only</p><hr/><p>importance of what has been taught consists in its
availability for further teaching, reflects the
pedagogue's view of life. The philosophy is
eloquent about the duty of the teacher in
instructing pupils; it is almost silent regarding his
privilege of learning. It emphasizes the influence
of intellectual environment upon the mind; it
slurs over the fact that the environment involves
a personal sharing in common experiences. It
exaggerates beyond reason the possibilities of
consciously formulated and used methods, and
underestimates the role of vital, unconscious,
attitudes. It insists upon the old, the past, and
passes lightly over the operation of the genuinely
novel and unforeseeable. It takes, in brief,
everything educational into account save its
essence,—vital energy seeking opportunity for
effective exercise. All education forms character,
mental and moral, but formation consists in the
selection and coordination of native activities so
that they may utilize the subject matter of the
social environment. Moreover, the formation is
not only a formation of native activities, but it
takes place through them. It is a process of
reconstruction, reorganization.
2. Education as  Recapitulation and
Retrospection. A peculiar combination of the ideas
of development and formation from without has
given rise to the recapitulation theory of
education, biological and cultural. The individual

mechanical choice of means.
(2) We have spoken as if aims could be
completely formed prior to the attempt to realize
them. This impression must now be qualified. The
aim as it first emerges is a mere tentative sketch.
The act of striving to realize it tests its worth. If it
suffices to direct activity successfully, nothing
more is required, since its whole function is to set
a mark in advance; and at times a mere hint may
suffice. But usually—at least in complicated
situations—acting upon it brings to light
conditions which had been overlooked. This calls
for revision of the original aim; it has to be added
to and subtracted from. An aim must, then, be
flexible; it must be capable of alteration to meet
circumstances. An end established externally to
the process of action is always rigid. Being
inserted or imposed from without, it is not
supposed to have a working relationship to the
concrete conditions of the situation. What
happens in the course of action neither confirms,
refutes, nor alters it. Such an end can only be
insisted upon. The failure that results from its lack
of adaptation is attributed simply to the
perverseness of conditions, not to the fact that the
end is not reasonable under the circumstances.
The value of a legitimate aim, on the contrary, lies</p><hr/>
