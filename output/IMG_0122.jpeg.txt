are political parties with differing aims, social sets,
cliques, gangs, corporations, partnerships, groups
bound closely together by ties of blood, and so on
in endless variety. In many modern states and in
some ancient, there is great diversity of
populations, of varying languages, religions,
moral codes, and traditions. From this standpoint,
many a minor political unit, one of our large cities,
for example, is a congeries of loosely associated
societies, rather than an inclusive and permeating
community of action and thought. (See ante, p. 20.)

The terms society, community, are thus
ambiguous. They have both a eulogistic or
normative sense, and a descriptive sense; a
meaning de jure and a meaning de facto. In social
philosophy, the former connotation is almost
always uppermost. Society is conceived as one by
its very nature. The qualities which accompany
this unity, praiseworthy community of purpose
and welfare, loyalty to public ends, mutuality of
sympathy, are emphasized. But when we look at
the facts which the term denotes instead of
confining our attention to its intrinsic connotation,
