assimilation of new presentations, their character
is all important. The effect of new presentations is
to reinforce groupings previously formed. The
business of the educator is, first, to select the
proper material in order to fix the nature of the
original reactions, and, secondly, to arrange the
sequence of subsequent presentations on the
basis of the store of ideas secured by prior
transactions. The control is from behind, from the
past, instead of, as in the unfolding conception, in
the ultimate goal.

(3) Certain formal steps of all method in
teaching may be laid down. Presentation of new
subject matter is obviously the central thing, but
since knowing consists in the way in which this
interacts with the contents already submerged
below consciousness, the first thing is the step of
"preparation,"â€”that is, calling into special activity
and getting above the floor of consciousness those
older presentations which are to assimilate the
new one. Then after the presentation, follow the
processes of interaction of new and old; then
comes the application of the newly formed
content to the performance of some task.
Everything must go through this course;
consequently there is a perfectly uniform method
in instruction in all subjects for all pupils of all
ages.

Herbart's great service lay in taking the work of
teaching out of the region of routine and accident.
