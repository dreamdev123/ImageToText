(i) By an interest we also mean the point at
which an object touches or engages a man; the
point where it influences him. In some legal
transactions a man has to prove "interest" in
order to have a standing at court. He has to show
that some proposed step concerns his affairs. A
silent partner has an interest in a business,
although he takes no active part in its conduct
because its prosperity or decline affects his profits
and liabilities.

(iii) When we speak of a man as interested in
this or that the emphasis falls directly upon his
personal attitude. To be interested is to be
absorbed in, wrapped up in, carried away by,
some object. To take an interest is to be on the
alert, to care about, to be attentive. We say of an
interested person both that he has lost himself in
some affair and that he has found himself in it.
Both terms express the engrossment of the self in
an object.

When the place of interest in education is
spoken of in a depreciatory way, it will be found
that the second of the meanings mentioned is first
exaggerated and then isolated. Interest is taken to
mean merely the effect of an object upon personal
advantage or disadvantage, success or failure.
