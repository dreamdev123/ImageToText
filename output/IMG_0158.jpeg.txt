direction which depends upon foresight of
possible future results, and there is no intelligence
in present behavior. Let there be imaginative
forecast but no attention to the conditions upon
which its attainment depends, and there is self-
deception or idle dreamingâ€”abortive intelligence.
If this illustration is typical, mind is not a name
for something complete by itself; it is a name for a
course of action in so far as that is intelligently
directed; in so far, that is to say, as aims, ends,

the attainment of aims. Intelligence is not a
peculiar possession which a person owns; but a
person is intelligent in so far as the activities in
which he plays a part have the qualities
mentioned. Nor are the activities in which a
person engages, whether intelligently or not,
