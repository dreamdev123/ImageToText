This is equivalent to saying that there is no
extensive number of common interests; there is
no free play back and forth among the members
of the social group. Stimulation and response are
exceedingly one-sided. In order to have a large
number of values in common, all the members of
the group must have an equable opportunity to
receive and to take from others. There must be a
large variety of shared undertakings and
experiences. Otherwise, the influences which
educate some into masters, educate others into
slaves. And the experience of each party loses in
meaning, when the free interchange of varying
modes of life-experience is arrested. A separation
into a privileged and a subject-class prevents
social endosmosis. The evils thereby affecting the
superior class are less material and less
perceptible, but equally real. Their culture tends
to be sterile, to be turned back to feed on itself;
their art becomes a showy display and artificial;
their wealth luxurious; their knowledge
overspecialized; their manners fastidious rather
than humane.

Lack of the free and equitable intercourse
which springs from a variety of shared interests
makes intellectual stimulation unbalanced.
