of intelligence in foresight, and contriving, is then
discounted; we are just to get out of the way and
allow nature to do the work. Since no one has
stated in the doctrine both its truth and falsity
better than Rousseau, we shall turn to him.

"Education," he says, "we receive from three
sourcesâ€”Nature, men, and things. The
spontaneous development of our organs and
capacities constitutes the education of Nature. The
use to which we are taught to put this
development constitutes that education given us
by Men. The acquirement of personal experience
from surrounding objects constitutes that of
things. Only when these three kinds of education
are consonant and make for the same end, does a
man tend towards his true goal. If we are asked
what is this end, the answer is that of Nature. For
since the concurrence of the three kinds of
education is necessary to their completeness, the
kind which is entirely independent of our control
must necessarily regulate us in determining the
other two." Then he defines Nature to mean the
capacities and dispositions which are inborn, "as
they exist prior to the modification due to
constraining habits and the influence of the
opinion of others."

The wording of Rousseau will repay careful
study. It contains as fundamental truths as have
been uttered about education in conjunction with
a curious twist. It would be impossible to say
