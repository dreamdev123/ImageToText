personality with social discipline and political
subordination. It made the national state an
intermediary between the realization of private
personality on one side and of humanity on the
other. Consequently, it is equally possible to state
its animating principle with equal truth either in
the classic terms of "harmonious development of
all the powers of personality” or in the more
recent terminology of "social efficiency." All this
reinforces the statement which opens this chapter:
The conception of education as a social process
and function has no definite meaning until we
define the kind of society we have in mind. These
considerations pave the way for our second
conclusion. One of the fundamental problems of
education in and for a democratic society is set by
the conflict of a nationalistic and a wider social
aim. The earlier cosmopolitan and
“humanitarian” conception suffered both from
vagueness and from lack of definite organs of
execution and agencies of administration. In
Europe, in the Continental states particularly, the
new idea of the importance of education for
human welfare and progress was captured by
national interests and harnessed to do a work
whose social aim was definitely narrow and
exclusive. The social aim of education and its
national aim were identified, and the result was a
marked obscuring of the meaning of a social aim.
This confusion corresponds to the existing
