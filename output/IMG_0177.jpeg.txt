develops, but his proper development consists in
repeating in orderly stages the past evolution of
animal life and human history. The former
recapitulation occurs physiologically; the latter
should be made to occur by means of education.
The alleged biological truth that the individual in
his growth from the simple embryo to maturity
repeats the history of the evolution of animal life
in the progress of forms from the simplest to the
most complex (or expressed technically, that
ontogenesis parallels phylogenesis) does not
concern us, save as it is supposed to afford
scientific foundation for cultural recapitulation of
the past. Cultural recapitulation says, first, that
children at a certain age are in the mental and
moral condition of savagery; their instincts are
vagrant and predatory because their ancestors at
one time lived such a life. Consequently (so it is
concluded) the proper subject matter of their
education at this time is the material—especially
the literary material of myths, folk-tale, and
song—produced by humanity in the analogous
stage. Then the child passes on to something
corresponding, say, to the pastoral stage, and so
on till at the time when he is ready to take part in
contemporary life, he arrives at the present epoch
of culture.

In this detailed and consistent form, the theory,
outside of a small school in Germany (followers of
Herbart for the most part), has had little currency.
