connected with one another. We can definitely
foresee results only as we make careful scrutiny
of present conditions, and the importance of the
outcome supplies the motive for observations.
The more adequate our observations, the more
varied is the scene of conditions and obstructions
that presents itself, and the more numerous are
the alternatives between which choice may be
made. In turn, the more numerous the recognized
possibilities of the situation, or alternatives of
action, the more meaning does the chosen activity
possess, and the more flexibly controllable is it.
‘Where only a single outcome has been thought of,
the mind has nothing else to think of; the meaning
attaching to the act is limited. One only steams
ahead toward the mark. Sometimes such a
narrow course may be effective. But if unexpected
difficulties offer themselves, one has not as many
resources at command as if he had chosen the
same line of action after a broader survey of the
possibilities of the field. He cannot make needed
readjustments readily.

The net conclusion is that acting with an aim is
all one with acting intelligently. To foresee a
terminus of an act is to have a basis upon which
to observe, to select, and to order objects and our
own capacities. To do these things means to have
a mind—for mind is precisely intentional
purposeful activity controlled by perception of
facts and their relationships to one another. To
