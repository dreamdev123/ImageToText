what we are about; conscious signifies the
deliberate, observant, planning traits of activity.
Consciousness is nothing which we have which
gazes idly on the scene around one or which has
impressions made upon it by physical things; it is
a name for the purposeful quality of an activity,
for the fact that it is directed by an aim. Put the
other way about, to have an aim is to act with
meaning, not like an automatic machine; it is to
mean to do something and to perceive the
meaning of things in the light of that intent.

2. The Criteria of Good Aims. We may apply the
results of our discussion to a consideration of the
criteria involved in a correct establishing of aims.
(1) The aim set up must be an outgrowth of
existing conditions. It must be based upon a
consideration of what is already going on; upon
the resources and difficulties of the situation.
Theories about the proper end of our activities—
educational and moral theories—often violate
this principle. They assume ends lying outside our
activities; ends foreign to the concrete makeup of
the situation; ends which issue from some outside
source. Then the problem is to bring our activities
to bear upon the realization of these externally
supplied ends. They are something for which we
ought to act. In any case such "aims" limit
intelligence; they are not the expression of mind
in foresight, observation, and choice of the better
among alternative possibilities. They limit
