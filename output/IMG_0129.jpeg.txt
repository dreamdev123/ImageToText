dependence of those arrangements upon the
means used to educate the young. It would be
impossible to find a deeper sense of the function
of education in discovering and developing
personal capacities, and training them so that
they would connect with the activities of others.
Yet the society in which the theory was
propounded was so undemocratic that Plato could
not work out a solution for the problem whose
terms he clearly saw.

â€˜While he affirmed with emphasis that the place
of the individual in society should not be
determined by birth or wealth or any
conventional status, but by his own nature as
discovered in the process of education, he had no
perception of the uniqueness of individuals. For
him they fall by nature into classes, and into a
very small number of classes at that
Consequently the testing and sifting function of
education only shows to which one of three
classes an individual belongs. There being no
recognition that each individual constitutes his
own class, there could be no recognition of the
infinite diversity of active tendencies and
combinations of tendencies of which an
individual is capable. There were only three types
of faculties or powers in the individual's
constitution. Hence education would soon reach a
static limit in each class, for only diversity makes
change and progress.
