But the idea which underlies it is that education is
essentially retrospective; that it looks primarily to
the past and especially to the literary products of
the past, and that mind is adequately formed in
the degree in which it is patterned upon the
spiritual heritage of the past. This idea has had
such immense influence upon higher instruction
especially, that it is worth examination in its
extreme formulation.

In the first place, its biological basis is fallacious.
Embyronic growth of the human infant preserves,
without doubt, some of the traits of lower forms
of life. But in no respect is it a strict traversing of
past stages. If there were any strict "law" of
repetition, evolutionary development would
clearly not have taken place. Each new
generation would simply have repeated its
predecessorsâ€™ existence. Development, in short,
has taken place by the entrance of shortcuts and
alterations in the prior scheme of growth. And
this suggests that the aim of education is to
facilitate such short-circuited growth. The great
advantage of immaturity, educationally speaking,
is that it enables us to emancipate the young from
the need of dwelling in an outgrown past. The
business of education is rather to liberate the
young from reviving and retraversing the past
than to lead them to a recapitulation of it. The
social environment of the young is constituted by
the presence and action of the habits of thinking
