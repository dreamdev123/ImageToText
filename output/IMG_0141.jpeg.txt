fact that we rarely make it explicit. We overlook
the fact that in growth there is ground to be
covered between an initial stage of process and
the completing period; that there is something
intervening. In learning, the present powers of the
pupil are the initial stage; the aim of the teacher
represents the remote limit. Between the two lie
means—that is middle conditions:—acts to be
performed; difficulties to be overcome; appliances
to be used. Only through them, in the literal time
sense, will the initial activities reach a satisfactory
consummation.

These intermediate conditions are of interest
precisely because the development of existing
activities into the foreseen and desired end
depends upon them. To be means for the
achieving of present tendencies, to be "between"
the agent and his end, to be of interest, are
different names for the same thing. When
material has to be made interesting, it signifies
that as presented, it lacks connection with
purposes and present power: or that if the
connection be there, it is not perceived. To make it
interesting by leading one to realize the
connection that exists is simply good sense; to
make it interesting by extraneous and artificial
inducements deserves all the bad names which
have been applied to the doctrine of interest in
education.

So much for the meaning of the term interest.
