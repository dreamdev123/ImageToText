to talk about the aim of education—or any other
undertaking—where conditions do not permit of
foresight of results, and do not stimulate a person
to look ahead to see what the outcome of a given
activity is to be. In the next place the aim as a
foreseen end gives direction to the activity; it is
not an idle view of a mere spectator, but
influences the steps taken to reach the end. The
foresight functions in three ways. In the first place,
it involves careful observation of the given
conditions to see what are the means available
for reaching the end, and to discover the
hindrances in the way. In the second place, it
suggests the proper order or sequence in the use
of means. It facilitates an economical selection
and arrangement. In the third place, it makes
choice of alternatives possible. If we can predict
the outcome of acting this way or that, we can
then compare the value of the two courses of
action; we can pass judgment upon their relative
desirability. If we know that stagnant water
breeds mosquitoes and that they are likely to
carry disease, we can, disliking that anticipated
result, take steps to avert it. Since we do not
anticipate results as mere intellectual onlookers,
but as persons concerned in the outcome, we are
partakers in the process which produces the
result. We intervene to bring about this result or
that.

Of course these three points are closely
