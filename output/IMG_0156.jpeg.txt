perverting them—and supposing that they have a
normal development apart from any use, which
development furnishes the standard and norm of
all learning by use. To recur to our previous
illustration, the process of acquiring language is a
practically perfect model of proper educative
growth. The start is from native activities of the
vocal apparatus, organs of hearing, etc. But it is
absurd to suppose that these have an
independent growth of their own, which left to
itself would evolve a perfect speech. Taken
literally, Rousseau's principle would mean that
adults should accept and repeat the babblings and
noises of children not merely as the beginnings of
the development of articulate speech—which they
are—but as furnishing language itself—the
standard for all teaching of language.

The point may be summarized by saying that
Rousseau was right, introducing a much-needed
reform into education, in holding that the
structure and activities of the organs furnish the
conditions of all teaching of the use of the organs;
but profoundly wrong in intimating that they
supply not only the conditions but also the ends of
their development. As matter of fact, the native
activities develop, in contrast with random and
capricious exercise, through the uses to which
they are put. And the office of the social medium
is, as we have seen, to direct growth through
putting powers to the best possible use. The
