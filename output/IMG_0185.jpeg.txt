indifferently and miscellaneously to any and
every detail. It is centered upon whatever has a
bearing upon the effective pursuit of your
occupation. Your look is ahead, and you are
concerned to note the existing facts because and
in so far as they are factors in the achievement of
the result intended. You have to find out what
your resources are, what conditions are at
command, and what the difficulties and obstacles
are. This foresight and this survey with reference
to what is foreseen constitute mind. Action that
does not involve such a forecast of results and
such an examination of means and hindrances is
either a matter of habit or else it is blind. In
neither case is it intelligent. To be vague and
uncertain as to what is intended and careless in
observation of conditions of its realization is to be,
in that degree, stupid or partially intelligent.

If we recur to the case where mind is not
concerned with the physical manipulation of the
instruments but with what one intends to write,
the case is the same. There is an activity in
process; one is taken up with the development of
a theme. Unless one writes as a phonograph talks,
this means intelligence; namely, alertness in
foreseeing the various conclusions to which
present data and considerations are tending,
together with continually renewed observation
and recollection to get hold of the subject matter
which bears upon the conclusions to be reached.
