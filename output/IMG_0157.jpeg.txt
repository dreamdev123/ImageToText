1. The Meaning of the Terms. We have already

events. Consequently he does whatever he can to
influence the direction present occurrences take.

take some steps which will influence future
happenings, if only to postpone the proposed
picnic. If a man sees a carriage coming which may
run over him, if he cannot stop its movement, he
can at least get out of the way if he foresees the
consequence in time. In many instances, he can
intervene even more directly. The attitude of a
