not due to the products, but to the life of which
they were the products. A knowledge of the past
and its heritage is of great significance when it
enters into the present, but not otherwise. And the
mistake of making the records and remains of the
past the main material of education is that it cuts
the vital connection of present and past, and tends
to make the past a rival of the present and the
present a more or less futile imitation of the past.
Under such circumstances, culture becomes an
ornament and solace; a refuge and an asylum.
Men escape from the crudities of the present to
live in its imagined refinements, instead of using
what the past offers as an agency for ripening
these crudities. The present, in short, generates
the problems which lead us to search the past for
suggestion, and which supplies meaning to what
we find when we search. The past is the past
precisely because it does not include what is
characteristic in the present. The moving present
includes the past on condition that it uses the past
to direct its own movement. The past is a great
resource for the imagination; it adds a new
dimension to life, but OD condition that it be seen
as the past of the present, and not as another and
disconnected world. The principle which makes

sets up is remote and empty. But having turned its
back upon the present, it has no way of returning
