effort, with mere strain, results when a mind is
set up, endowed with powers that are only to be
applied to existing material. A person just either
will or will not apply himself to the matter in
hand. The more indifferent the subject matter, the
less concern it has for the habits and preferences
of the individual, the more demand there is for an
effort to bring the mind to bear upon itâ€”and
hence the more discipline of will. To attend to
material because there is something to be done in
which the person is concerned is not disciplinary
in this view; not even if it results in a desirable
increase of constructive power. Application just
for the sake of application, for the sake of training,
is alone disciplinary. This is more likely to occur if
the subject matter presented is uncongenial, for
then there is no motive (so it is supposed) except
the acknowledgment of duty or the value of
discipline. The logical result is expressed with
literal truth in the words of an American
humorist: "It makes no difference what you teach
a boy so long as he doesn't like it."

The counterpart of the isolation of mind from
activities dealing with objects to accomplish ends
is isolation of the subject matter to be learned. In
the traditional schemes of education, subject
matter means so much material to be studied.
Various branches of study represent so many
independent branches, each having its principles
of arrangement complete within itself. History is
