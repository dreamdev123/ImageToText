Much which has been said so far is borrowed
from what Plato first consciously taught the
world. But conditions which he could not
intellectually control led him to restrict these
ideas in their application. He never got any
conception of the indefinite plurality of activities
which may characterize an individual and a
social group, and consequently limited his view to
a limited number of classes of capacities and of
social arrangements. Plato's starting point is that
the organization of society depends ultimately
upon knowledge of the end of existence. If we do
not know its end, we shall be at the mercy of
accident and caprice. Unless we know the end, the
good, we shall have no criterion for rationally
deciding what the possibilities are which should
be promoted, nor how social arrangements are to
be ordered. We shall have no conception of the
proper limits and distribution of activities—what
he called justice—as a trait of both individual and
social organization. But how is the knowledge of
the final and permanent good to be achieved? In
dealing with this question we come upon the
seemingly insuperable obstacle that such
knowledge is not possible save in a just and
harmonious social order. Everywhere else the
mind is distracted and misled by false valuations
and false perspectives. A disorganized and
factional society sets up a number of different
models and standards. Under such conditions it is
impossible for the individual to attain consistency
