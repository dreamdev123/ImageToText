and feeling of civilized men. To ignore the
directive influence of this present environment
upon the young is simply to abdicate the
educational function. A biologist has said: "The
history of development in different animals. . .
offers to us. . . a series of ingenious, determined,
varied but more or less unsuccessful efforts to
escape from the necessity of recapitulating, and to
substitute for the ancestral method a more direct
method." Surely it would be foolish if education
did not deliberately attempt to facilitate similar
efforts in conscious experience so that they
become increasingly successful.

The two factors of truth in the conception may
easily be disentangled from association with the
false context which perverts them. On the
biological side we have simply the fact that any
infant starts with precisely the assortment of
impulsive activities with which he does start, they
being blind, and many of them conflicting with
one another, casual, sporadic, and unadapted to
their immediate environment. The other point is
thatit is a part of wisdom to utilize the products of
past history so far as they are of help for the
future. Since they represent the results of prior
