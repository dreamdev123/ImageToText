that opportunity for development of distinctive
capacities be afforded all. The separation of the
two aims in education is fatal to democracy; the
adoption of the narrower meaning of efficiency
deprives it of its essential justification.

The aim of efficiency (like any educational aim)
must be included within the process of experience.
When it is measured by tangible external
products, and not by the achieving of a
distinctively valuable experience, it becomes
materialistic. Results in the way of commodities
which may be the outgrowth of an efficient
personality are, in the strictest sense, by-products
of education: by-products which are inevitable
and important, but nevertheless by-products. To
set up an external aim strengthens by reaction
the false conception of culture which identifies it
with something purely "inner." And the idea of
perfecting an "inner" personality is a sure sign of
social divisions. What is called inner is simply that
which does not connect with others—which is not
capable of free and full communication. What is
termed spiritual culture has usually been futile,
with something rotten about it, just because it has
been conceived as a thing which a man might
have internally—and therefore exclusively. What
one is as a person is what one is as associated
with others, in a free give and take of intercourse.
This transcends both the efficiency which consists
in supplying products to others and the culture
