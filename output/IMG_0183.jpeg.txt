1. Education as Formation. We now come to a
type of theory which denies the existence of
faculties and emphasizes the unique role of
subject matter in the development of mental and
moral disposition. According to it, education is
neither a process of unfolding from within nor is
it a training of faculties resident in mind itself. It is
rather the formation of mind by setting up certain
associations or connections of content by means
of a subject matter presented from without.
Education proceeds by instruction taken in a
strictly literal sense, a building into the mind from
without. That education is formative of mind is
not questioned; it is the conception already
propounded. But formation here has a technical
meaning dependent upon the idea of something
operating from without. Herbart is the best
historical representative of this type of theory. He
denies absolutely the existence of innate faculties.
The mind is simply endowed with the power of
producing various qualities in reaction to the
various realities which act upon it. These
qualitatively different reactions are called
presentations (Vorstellungen). Every presentation
once called into being persists; it may be driven
