I Let us apply the first element in this criterion
to a despotically governed state. It is not true
there is no common interest in such an
organization between governed and governors.
The authorities in command must make some
appeal to the native activities of the subjects, must
call some of their powers into play. Talleyrand
said that a government could do everything with
bayonets except sit on them. This cynical
declaration is at least a recognition that the bond
of union is not merely one of coercive force. It
may be said, however, that the activities appealed
to are themselves unworthy and degrading—that
such a government calls into functioning activity
simply capacity for fear. In a way, this statement
is true. But it overlooks the fact that fear need not
be an undesirable factor in experience. Caution,
circumspection, prudence, desire to foresee future
events so as to avert what is harmful, these
desirable traits are as much a product of calling
the impulse of fear into play as is cowardice and
abject submission. The real difficulty is that the
appeal to fear is isolated. In evoking dread and
hope of specific tangible reward—say comfort and
ease—many other capacities are left untouched.
Or rather, they are affected, but in such a way as
to pervert them. Instead of operating on their own
account they are reduced to mere servants of
attaining pleasure and avoiding pain.
