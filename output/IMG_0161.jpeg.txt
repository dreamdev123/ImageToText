The problem of instruction is thus that of
finding material which will engage a person in
specific activities having an aim or purpose of
moment or interest to him, and dealing with
things not as gymnastic appliances but as
conditions for the attainment of ends. The remedy
for the evils attending the doctrine of formal
discipline previously spoken of, is not to be found
by substituting a doctrine of specialized
disciplines, but by reforming the notion of mind
and its training. Discovery of typical modes of
activity, whether play or useful occupations, in
which individuals are concerned, in whose
outcome they recognize they have something at
stake, and which cannot be carried through
without reflection and use of judgment to select
material of observation and recollection, is the
remedy. In short, the root of the error long
prevalent in the conception of training of mind
consists in leaving out of account movements of
things to future results in which an individual
shares, and in the direction of which observation,
imagination, and memory are enlisted. It consists
in regarding mind as complete in itself, ready to
be directly applied to a present material.

In historic practice the error has cut two ways.
On one hand, it has screened and protected
traditional studies and methods of teaching from
intelligent criticism and needed revisions. To say
that they are "disciplinary" has safeguarded them
