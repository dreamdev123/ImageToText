1. Nature as Supplying the Aim. We have just
pointed out the futility of trying to establish the
aim of education—some one final aim which
subordinates all others to itself. We have
indicated that since general aims are but
prospective points of view from which to survey
the existing conditions and estimate their
possibilities, we might have any number of them,
all consistent with one another. As matter of fact,
a large number have been stated at different
times, all having great local value. For the
statement of aim is a matter of emphasis at a
given time. And we do not emphasize things
which do not require emphasis—that is, such
things as are taking care of themselves fairly well.
We tend rather to frame our statement on the
basis of the defects and needs of the
contemporary situation; we take for granted,
without explicit statement which would be of no
use, whatever is right or approximately so. We
frame our explicit aims in terms of some
alteration to be brought about. It is, then, DO
paradox requiring explanation that a given epoch
or generation tends to emphasize in its conscious
projections just the things which it has least of in
actual fact. A time of domination by authority will
call out as response the desirability of great
individual freedom; one of disorganized
individual activities the need of social control as
an educational aim.
