intelligence because, given ready-made, they must
be imposed by some authority external to
intelligence, leaving to the latter nothing but a
mechanical choice of means.

(2) We have spoken as if aims could be
completely formed prior to the attempt to realize
them. This impression must now be qualified. The
aim as it first emerges is a mere tentative sketch.
The act of striving to realize it tests its worth. If it
suffices to direct activity successfully, nothing
more is required, since its whole function is to set
a mark in advance; and at times a mere hint may
suffice. But usually—at least in complicated
situations—acting upon it brings to light
conditions which had been overlooked. This calls
for revision of the original aim; it has to be added
to and subtracted from. An aim must, then, be
flexible; it must be capable of alteration to meet
circumstances. An end established externally to
the process of action is always rigid. Being
inserted or imposed from without, it is not
supposed to have a working relationship to the
concrete conditions of the situation. What
happens in the course of action neither confirms,
refutes, nor alters it. Such an end can only be
insisted upon. The failure that results from its lack
of adaptation is attributed simply to the
perverseness of conditions, not to the fact that the
end is not reasonable under the circumstances.
The value of a legitimate aim, on the contrary, lies
