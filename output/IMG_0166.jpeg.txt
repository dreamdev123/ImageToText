intellectual opportunities are accessible to all on
equable and easy terms. A society marked off into
classes need he specially attentive only to the
education of its ruling elements. A society which is
mobile, which is full of channels for the
distribution of a change occurring anywhere,
must see to it that its members are educated to
personal initiative and adaptability. Otherwise,
they will be overwhelmed by the changes in
which they are caught and whose significance or
connections they do not perceive. The result will
be a confusion in which a few will appropriate to
themselves the results of the blind and externally
directed activities of others.

3. The Platonic Educational Philosophy.
Subsequent chapters will be devoted to making
explicit the implications of the democratic ideas in
education. In the remaining portions of this
chapter, we shall consider the educational
theories which have been evolved in three epochs
when the social import of education was
especially conspicuous. The first one to be
considered is that of Plato. No one could better
express than did he the fact that a society is stably
organized when each individual is doing that for
which he has aptitude by nature in such a way as
to be useful to others (or to contribute to the
whole to which he belongs); and that it is the
business of education to discover these aptitudes
and progressively to train them for social use.
