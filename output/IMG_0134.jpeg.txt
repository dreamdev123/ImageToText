differences of endowment the dynamic values of
natural inequalities of growth, and utilize them,
preferring irregularity to the rounding out gained
by pruning will most closely follow that which
takes place in the body and thus prove most
effective.” 1 Observation of natural tendencies is
difficult under conditions of restraint. They show
themselves most readily in a child's spontaneous
sayings and doings,—that is, in those he engages
in when not put at set tasks and when not aware
of being under observation. It does not follow that
these tendencies are all desirable because they
are natural; but it does follow that since they are
there, they are operative and must be taken
account of. We must see to it that the desirable
ones have an environment which keeps them
active, and that their activity shall control the
direction the others take and thereby induce the
disuse of the latter because they lead to nothing.
Many tendencies that trouble parents when they
appear are likely to be transitory, and sometimes
too much direct attention to them only fixes a
child's attention upon them. At all events, adults
too easily assume their own habits and wishes as
standards, and regard all deviations of children's
impulses as evils to be eliminated. That
artificiality against which the conception of
following nature is so largely a protest, is the
outcome of attempts to force children directly into
the mold of grown-up standards.
