combination of the two. Subject matter is then
regarded as something complete in itself, it is just
something to be learned or known, either by the
voluntary application of mind to it or through the
impressions it makes on mind.

The facts of interest show that these
conceptions are mythical. Mind appears in
experience as ability to respond to present stimuli
on the basis of anticipation of future possible
consequences, and with a view to controlling the
kind of consequences that are to take place. The
things, the subject matter known, consist of
whatever is recognized as having a bearing upon
the anticipated course of events, whether
assisting or retarding it. These statements are too
formal to be very intelligible. An illustration may
clear up their significance. You are engaged in a
certain occupation, say writing with a typewriter.
If you are an expert, your formed habits take care
of the physical movements and leave your
thoughts free to consider your topic. Suppose,
however, you are not skilled, or that, even if you
are, the machine does not work well. You then
have to use intelligence. You do not wish to strike
the keys at random and let the consequences be
what they may; you wish to record certain words
in a given order so as to make sense. You attend to
the keys, to what you have written, to your
movements, to the ribbon or the mechanism of
the machine. Your attention is not distributed
