because after the act is performed we note results
which we had not noted before. But much work in
school consists in setting up rules by which pupils
are to act of such a sort that even after pupils
have acted, they are not led to see the connection
between the result—say the answer—and the
method pursued. So far as they are concerned, the
whole thing is a trick and a kind of miracle. Such
action is essentially capricious, and leads to
capricious habits. (b) Routine action, action which
is automatic, may increase skill to do a particular
thing. In so far, it might be said to have an
educative effect. But it does not lead to new
perceptions of bearings and connections; it limits
rather than widens the meaning-horizon. And
since the environment changes and our way of
acting has to be modified in order successfully to
keep a balanced connection with things, an
isolated uniform way of acting becomes
disastrous at some critical moment. The vaunted
"skill" turns out gross ineptitude.

The essential contrast of the idea of education
as continuous reconstruction with the other one-
sided conceptions which have been criticized in
this and the previous chapter is that it identifies
the end (the result) and the process. This is
verbally self-contradictory, but only verbally. It
means that experience as an active process
occupies time and that its later period completes
its earlier portion; it brings to light connections
