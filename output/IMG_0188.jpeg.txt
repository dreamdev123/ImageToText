experience at the time and those in which they
are taught to acquiesce. Until the democratic
criterion of the intrinsic significance of every
growing experience is recognized, we shall be
intellectually confused by the demand for
adaptation to external aims.

(3) Educators have to be on their guard against
ends that are alleged to be general and ultimate.
Every activity, however specific, is, of course,
general in its ramified connections, for it leads out
indefinitely into other things. So far as a general
idea makes us more alive to these connections, it
cannot be too general. But "general" also means
"abstract," or detached from all specific context.
And such abstractness means remoteness, and
throws us back, once more, upon teaching and
learning as mere means of getting ready for an
end disconnected from the means. That education
is literally and all the time its own reward means
that no alleged study or discipline is educative
unless it is worth while in its own immediate
having. A truly general aim broadens the outlook;
it stimulates one to take more consequences
(connections) into account. This means a wider
and more flexible observation of means. The
more interacting forces, for example, the farmer
takes into account, the more varied will be his
immediate resources. He will see a greater
number of possible starting places, and a greater
number of ways of getting at what he wants to do.
