concerned with the reconciliation of national
loyalty, of patriotism, with superior devotion to
the things which unite men in common ends,
irrespective of national political boundaries.
Neither phase of the problem can be worked out
by merely negative means. It is not enough to see
to it that education is not actively used as an
instrument to make easier the exploitation of one
class by another. School facilities must be secured
of such amplitude and efficiency as will in fact
and not simply in name discount the effects of
economic inequalities, and secure to all the wards
of the nation equality of equipment for their
future careers. Accomplishment of this end
demands not only adequate administrative
provision of school facilities, and such
supplementation of family resources as will
enable youth to take advantage of them, but also
such modification of traditional ideals of culture,
traditional subjects of study and traditional
methods of teaching and discipline as will retain
all the youth under educational influences until
they are equipped to be masters of their own
economic and social careers. The ideal may seem

system of education. The same principle has
application on the side of the considerations
which concern the relations of one nation to
