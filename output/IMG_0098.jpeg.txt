construction of specific procedures, and unless
these procedures test, correct, and amplify the
aim, the latter is worthless. Instead of helping the
specific task of teaching, it prevents the use of
ordinary judgment in observing and sizing up the
situation. It operates to exclude recognition of
everything except what squares up with the fixed
end in view. Every rigid aim just because it is
rigidly given seems to render it unnecessary to
give careful attention to concrete conditions. Since
it must apply anyhow, what is the use of noting
details which do not count?

The vice of externally imposed ends has deep
roots. Teachers receive them from superior
authorities; these authorities accept them from
what is current in the community. The teachers
impose them upon children. As a first
consequence, the intelligence of the teacher is not
free; it is confined to receiving the aims laid down
from above. Too rarely is the individual teacher so
free from the dictation of authoritative supervisor,
textbook on methods, prescribed course of study,
etc, that he can let his mind come to close
quarters with the pupil's mind and the subject
matter. This distrust of the teacher's experience is
then reflected in lack of confidence in the
responses of pupils. The latter receive their aims
through a double or treble external imposition,
and are constantly confused by the conflict
between the aims which are natural to their own
