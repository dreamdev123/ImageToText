existing institutions. The extent of the
transformation of educational philosophy which
occurred in Germany in the generation occupied
by the struggle against Napoleon for national
independence, may be gathered from Kant, who
well expresses the earlier individual-
cosmopolitan ideal. In his treatise on Pedagogics,
consisting of lectures given in the later years of
the eighteenth century, he defines education as
the process by which man becomes man.
Mankind begins its history submerged in natureâ€”
not as Man who is a creature of reason, while
nature furnishes only instinct and appetite.
Nature offers simply the germs which education
is to develop and perfect. The peculiarity of truly
human life is that man has to create himself by
his own voluntary efforts; he has to make himself
a truly moral, rational, and free being. This
creative effort is carried on by the educational
activities of slow generations. Its acceleration
depends upon men consciously striving to educate
their successors not for the existing state of
affairs but so as to make possible a future better
humanity. But there is the great difficulty. Each
generation is inclined to educate its young so as to
get along in the present world instead of with a

promotion of the best possible realization of
humanity as humanity. Parents educate their
children so that they may get on; princes educate
