suggest improvement. Now in any social group
whatever, even in a gang of thieves, we find some
interest held in common, and we find a certain
amount of interaction and cooperative
intercourse with other groups. From these two
traits we derive our standard. How numerous
and varied are the interests which are
consciously shared? How full and free is the
interplay with other forms of association? If we
apply these considerations to, say, a criminal band,
we find that the ties which consciously hold the
members together are few in number, reducible
almost to a common interest in plunder; and that
they are of such a nature as to isolate the group
from other groups with respect to give and take of
the values of life. Hence, the education such a
society gives is partial and distorted. If we take, on
the other hand, the kind of family life which
illustrates the standard, we find that there are
material, intellectual, aesthetic interests in which
all participate and that the progress of one
member has worth for the experience of other
members—it is readily communicable—and that
the family is not an isolated whole, but enters
intimately into relationships with business groups,
with schools, with all the agencies of culture, as
