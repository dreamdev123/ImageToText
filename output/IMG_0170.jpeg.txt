external; they are shifting things about. No ideal
reward, no enrichment of emotion and intellect,
accompanies them. Others contribute to the
maintenance of life, and to its external adornment
and display. Many of our existing social activities,
industrial and political, fall in these two classes.
Neither the people who engage in them, nor those
who are directly affected by them, are capable of
full and free interest in their work. Because of the
lack of any purpose in the work for the one doing
it, or because of the restricted character of its aim,
intelligence is not adequately engaged. The same
conditions force many people back upon
themselves. They take refuge in an inner play of
sentiment and fancies. They are aesthetic but not
artistic, since their feelings and ideas are turned
upon themselves, instead of being methods in acts
which modify conditions. Their mental life is
sentimental; an enjoyment of an inner landscape.
Even the pursuit of science may become an
asylum of refuge from the hard conditions of life—
not a temporary retreat for the sake of
recuperation and clarification in future dealings
with the world. The very word art may become
associated not with specific transformation of
things, making them more significant for mind,
but with stimulations of eccentric fancy and with
emotional indulgences. The separation and
mutual contempt of the “practical” man and the
man of theory or culture, the divorce of fine and
industrial arts, are indications of this situation.
