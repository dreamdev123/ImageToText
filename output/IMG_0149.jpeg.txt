they are likely to do to him; and that, on the basis
of his expectation or foresight, he is eager to act so
as to give things one turn rather than another.
Interest and aims, concern and purpose, are
necessarily connected. Such words as aim, intent,
end, emphasize the results which are wanted and
striven for; they take for granted the personal
attitude of solicitude and attentive eagerness.
Such words as interest, affection, concern,
motivation, emphasize the bearing of what is
foreseen upon the individual's fortunes, and his
active desire to act to secure a possible result.
They take for granted the objective changes. But
the difference is but one of emphasis; the meaning
that is shaded in one set of words is illuminated in
the other. What is anticipated is objective and
impersonal; to-morrow's rain; the possibility of
being run over. But for an active being, a being
who partakes of the consequences instead of
standing aloof from them, there is at the same
time a personal response. The difference
imaginatively foreseen makes a present
difference, which finds expression in solicitude
and effort. While such words as affection, concern,
and motive indicate an attitude of personal
preference, they are always attitudes toward
objectsâ€”toward what is foreseen. We may call
the phase of objective foresight intellectual, and
the phase of personal concern emotional and
volitional, but there is no separation in the facts of
the situation.
