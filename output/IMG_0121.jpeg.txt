marketing of goods. No doubt, a very acute and
intense intelligence in these narrow lines can be
developed, but the failure to take into account the
significant social factors means none the less an
absence of mind, and a corresponding distortion
of emotional life. II. This illustration (whose point
is to be extended to all associations lacking
reciprocity of interest) brings us to our second
point. The isolation and exclusiveness of a gang or
clique brings its antisocial spirit into relief. But
this same spirit is found wherever one group has
interests "of its own" which shut it out from full
