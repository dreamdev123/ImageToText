instinctive activities may be called, metaphorically,
spontaneous, in the sense that the organs give a
strong bias for a certain sort of operation,â€”a bias
so strong that we cannot go contrary to it, though
by trying to go contrary we may pervert, stunt,
and corrupt them. But the notion of a
spontaneous normal development of these
activities is pure mythology. The natural, or native,
powers furnish the initiating and limiting forces
in all education; they do not furnish its ends or
aims. There is no learning except from a
beginning in unlearned powers, but learning is
not a matter of the spontaneous overflow of the
unlearned powers. Rousseau's contrary opinion is
doubtless due to the fact that he identified God
with Nature; to him the original powers are
wholly good, coming directly from a wise and
good creator. To paraphrase the old saying about
the country and the town, God made the original
human organs and faculties, man makes the uses
to which they are put. Consequently the
development of the former furnishes the standard
to which the latter must be subordinated. When
men attempt to determine the uses to which the
original activities shall be put, they interfere with
a divine plan. The interference by social
arrangements with Nature, God's work, is the
primary source of corruption in individuals.
Rousseau's passionate assertion of the intrinsic
goodness of all natural tendencies was a reaction
