engaged in activity which is socially serviceable,
but whose service they do not understand and
have no personal interest in. Much is said about
scientific management of work. It is a narrow
view which restricts the science which secures
efficiency of operation to movements of the
muscles. The chief opportunity for science is the
discovery of the relations of a man to his work—
including his relations to others who take part—
‘which will enlist his intelligent interest in what he
