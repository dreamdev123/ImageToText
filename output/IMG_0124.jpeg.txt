In conclusion, we note that the early history of
the idea of following nature combined two factors
which had no inherent connection with one
another. Before the time of Rousseau educational
reformers had been inclined to urge the
importance of education by ascribing practically
unlimited power to it. All the differences between
peoples and between classes and persons among
the same people were said to be due to differences
of training, of exercise, and practice. Originally,
mind, reason, understanding is, for all practical
purposes, the same in all. This essential identity of
mind means the essential equality of all and the
possibility of bringing them all to the same level.
As a protest against this view, the doctrine of
accord with nature meant a much less formal and
abstract view of mind and its powers. It
substituted specific instincts and impulses and
physiological capacities, differing from individual
to individual (just as they differ, as Rousseau
pointed out, even in dogs of the same litter), for
abstract faculties of discernment, memory, and
generalization. Upon this side, the doctrine of
educative accord with nature has been reinforced
by the development of modern biology, physiology,
and psychology. It means, in effect, that great as is
the significance of nurture, of modification, and
transformation through direct educational effort,
nature, or unlearned capacities, affords the
foundation and ultimate resources for such
nurture. On the other hand, the doctrine of
