results, and with it greater promise for a social
service which goes beyond the supply in quantity
of material commodities. For how can there be a
society really worth serving unless it is

personality to social efficiency is a product of a
feudally organized society with its rigid division of
inferior and superior. The latter are supposed to
have time and opportunity to develop themselves
as human beings; the former are confined to
providing external products. When social
efficiency as measured by product or output is
urged as an ideal in a would-be democratic society,
