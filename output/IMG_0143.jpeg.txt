in the fact that we can use it to change conditions.
It is a method for dealing with conditions so as to
effect desirable alterations in them. A farmer who
should passively accept things just as he finds
them would make as great a mistake as he who
framed his plans in complete disregard of what
soil, climate, etc., permit. One of the evils of an
abstract or remote external aim in education is
that its very inapplicability in practice is likely to
react into a haphazard snatching at immediate
conditions. A good aim surveys the present state
of experience of pupils, and forming a tentative
plan of treatment, keeps the plan constantly in
view and yet modifies it as conditions develop.
The aim, in short, is experimental, and hence
constantly growing as it is tested in action.

(3) The aim must always represent a freeing of
activities. The term end in view is suggestive, for it
puts before the mind the termination or
conclusion of some process. The only way in
which we can define an activity is by putting
before ourselves the objects in which it
terminatesâ€”as one's aim in shooting is the target.
But we must remember that the object is only a
mark or sign by which the mind specifies the
activity one desires to carry out. Strictly speaking,
not the target but hitting the target is the end in
view; one takes aim by means of the target, but
also by the sight on the gun. The different objects
which are thought of are means of directing the
